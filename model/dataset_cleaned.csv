"The digital display board at the bus station, which is supposed to show bus timings, is always blank. It causes a lot of confusion and inconvenience for the passengers.",2,29
The public art installation at the city entrance has been vandalized with graffiti. It's an ugly sight and needs to be cleaned and restored. There should also be better security to prevent this.,2,33
The senior citizen recreation center is just a single room with a few broken chairs. It's not a welcoming space. Our elders deserve a much better facility with more activities and amenities.,2,32
"The public vaccination center is very poorly managed. There are long, unorganized queues and no proper seating or ventilation. It's a chaotic and unsafe environment.",2,25
"The free legal aid cell at the district court is not very accessible. The information about its services is not widely publicized, and many poor people who need it are not even aware of its existence.",2,36
The designated vending zones for street food are not provided with basic amenities like water supply or waste disposal bins. This forces the vendors to operate in unhygienic conditions.,2,29
"The historical monument in the city is being neglected. The walls are crumbling, and there's trash everywhere. The archaeological department needs to take better care of our heritage.",2,28
"The government fair price shop often has a 'no stock' board. Essential commodities are not available on time, causing hardship for the ration card holders.",2,25
The mobile science van that is supposed to visit schools in rural areas has not come to our village in over a year. Our children are missing out on this important learning opportunity.,2,33
"The check-dam built to conserve water is leaking and has developed cracks. It needs to be repaired before the monsoon, or it might collapse, causing a flood in the downstream villages.",2,31
"The community radio station has very poor transmission quality. It's an important source of local news and information, and its equipment needs to be upgraded.",2,25
"The public boat club is in a state of disrepair. The boats are old and unsafe, and the jetty is broken. It has the potential to be a great recreational spot if it is maintained.",2,35
The government employment exchange office is not helpful at all. They just ask you to register online and never provide any real job assistance or counseling.,2,26
"The drinking water ATMs that were installed are either out of service or dispense unclean water. The concept is good, but the implementation and maintenance are a complete failure.",2,29
The state-run emporium meant to promote local artisans is located in a remote corner of the city and is poorly marketed. The artisans are not getting the platform they deserve.,2,30
The emergency helpline number for civic issues is always engaged or the person who answers is clueless. The system is inefficient and does not solve the citizen's problems.,2,28
The public observation deck that offers a view of the city is dirty and the telescopes are broken. It's a missed opportunity to create a good tourist experience.,2,28
The cultural center has no activities scheduled for months. The building is lying unused while there is a great demand for a space for artists to perform and exhibit their work.,2,31
"The public parking facility is poorly managed. There is no system, and the attendants often overcharge. We need a more organized and transparent parking system.",2,25
"We have been experiencing frequent and unannounced power cuts for the last three days, each lasting for 3-4 hours. This is causing a lot of problems with online classes for our children and work-from-home schedules.",3,35
"The electricity transformer in our neighborhood makes a loud, humming sound and frequently trips, leading to a complete blackout. We are afraid it is overloaded and might catch fire. It needs to be checked by the department.",3,37
"The electricity bill I received this month is almost double the usual amount, even though our consumption has not changed. I am sure there is an issue with the meter, and I request a meter inspection.",3,36
"There is an electricity pole right in front of my house that is dangerously tilted and looks like it could fall anytime, especially during strong winds. The wires are also hanging very low. It's a major safety hazard.",3,38
"A bundle of open, tangled electrical wires is hanging from the pole on our street. It's a death trap waiting for an accident, especially during the rainy season. These need to be secured and organized immediately.",3,36
"We applied for a new electricity connection over two months ago, and despite completing all the formalities and payments, there has been no action from the electricity board. The delay is inexplicable and frustrating.",3,34
"The voltage in our area fluctuates wildly throughout the day. We are constantly worried about our expensive electronic appliances like the TV, fridge, and AC getting damaged due to these surges and dips.",3,33
"After a recent storm, a live high-tension wire has snapped and fallen on the road. The area has not been cordoned off, and it's extremely dangerous for anyone passing by. An emergency team needs to be dispatched right away.",3,39
"The streetlights in our area remain switched on even during broad daylight, leading to a colossal waste of electricity. This is happening every day. The automated timer system seems to be faulty.",3,32
"I want to report a case of power theft. The factory next to our colony has a direct hook to the main line, bypassing their meter. This is illegal and also puts an excessive load on the local transformer.",3,39
The electricity department personnel came to fix a fault but left the junction box open with all wires exposed. This is gross negligence and is very dangerous for the kids who play on the street.,3,35
The power supply to our agricultural pump set is very erratic and is not provided as per the announced schedule. This is affecting our irrigation cycle and will damage our crops.,3,31
The new smart meter that was installed is showing very erratic readings. The mobile app also does not update correctly. The new system seems to have a lot of glitches that need to be ironed out.,3,36
"There is no electricity in our building for the past 12 hours because of a fault in the main supply cable. We have registered multiple complaints, but no technician has been assigned to our case yet.",3,36
"The transformer in our area is not fenced or protected. Children often play near it, and stray animals wander in, which is very dangerous. It needs to be properly enclosed for safety.",3,32
"The billing cycle is very inconsistent. Sometimes we get a bill for 45 days and sometimes for 25 days, which makes it very difficult to manage our household budget. It should be a fixed monthly cycle.",3,36
"The call center for the electricity board is a nightmare. It takes forever to connect, and when you do, the staff is rude and unable to provide any useful information about power restoration times.",3,34
The wooden electricity poles in our old city area are rotting from the base and are in a state of decay. They need to be replaced with concrete or steel poles before they collapse.,3,34
The process for increasing the sanctioned load for our connection is very cumbersome and involves too much paperwork and running around. It should be simplified and made available online.,3,29
"During the rainy season, we often get a mild electric shock from the metallic gate and railings of our house. This indicates there is some current leakage in the main supply line to our house, which is very scary.",3,39
"The electricity department is conducting tree trimming near the power lines, but they are leaving all the chopped branches on the road, blocking traffic and creating a mess. They should be responsible for clearing the debris.",3,36
"The prepaid electricity meter system is causing a lot of problems. It often disconnects at odd hours, like late at night, and there is no easy way to recharge it immediately, leaving us in the dark.",3,36
"The electricity board is imposing long, scheduled power cuts for maintenance without any prior intimation to the consumers. A simple SMS alert a day before would be very helpful for us to plan our work.",3,35
"The new underground cabling work has been left incomplete. The pits are still open, and the work seems to have been abandoned for weeks. This is a safety hazard and an inconvenience.",3,32
A bird's nest on the transformer is causing frequent short circuits and power trips in our area. Can the department please help in safely removing the nest to ensure an uninterrupted power supply?,3,33
The temporary connection provided for a festival event has not been removed even weeks after the event is over. The wires are lying dangerously on the ground and need to be disconnected.,3,32
The customer service at the local electricity office is very poor. The officials are not helpful and treat consumers with disrespect. There is a need for better training and accountability.,3,30
"The online bill payment portal for the electricity board frequently crashes, especially near the due date. This forces people to stand in long queues at the payment centers. The IT infrastructure needs a serious upgrade.",3,35
"Our entire street has low voltage issues, but the neighboring street has a normal supply. It seems there is a fault in the specific distribution line that serves our street.",3,30
"A private internet cable company has tied its wires all over the electricity poles, creating a cluttered and ugly mess. Is this legal? It also puts an extra load on the poles and makes maintenance difficult.",3,36
The refund for the security deposit after surrendering a connection has not been processed for over six months. There is no clear communication from the department on the status of our refund.,3,32
"The electricity meter readers often record incorrect readings, leading to inflated bills. We then have to go through the lengthy process of getting the bill corrected. There should be a system of photographic evidence of the meter reading.",3,38
The fuse unit for our apartment complex keeps blowing out every few days. It's old and unable to handle the load. We request the department to replace it with a higher capacity unit.,3,33
The solar power net metering policy is not being implemented properly. The bills are not being adjusted correctly for the power we export to the grid. There is a lot of confusion and lack of clarity.,3,36
"The electricity department vehicle is parked in a no-parking zone all day near their office, causing inconvenience to the public. They should follow the rules just like everyone else.",3,29
"The reconnection process after a disconnection for non-payment is very slow. Even after paying the bill and the penalty, it takes them more than 24 hours to restore the power supply.",3,31
There is a constant humming and vibrating noise coming from the high-tension power lines that pass over our house. It is very disturbing and also a cause for concern regarding radiation.,3,31
"The electricity subsidy is not being applied correctly to my bill. I am eligible for the subsidy scheme, but I have been charged the full amount for the last three months.",3,31
"The new substation that was promised for our rapidly developing area has been delayed for years. The existing infrastructure is overloaded, leading to all these power cuts and voltage problems.",3,30
The contractor for the electricity department dug up the road to lay a cable and did not restore it properly. The patch is uneven and has sunk in. The department must ensure their contractors do a proper job.,3,38
"The contact numbers for the local junior engineer and other officials are not displayed on the electricity board's website. In case of an emergency, we have no one to contact directly.",3,31
"The electricity supply to our water pumping station is frequently cut, which disrupts the entire water supply schedule for the city. A dedicated, uninterrupted power line should be provided for essential services.",3,32
"The interest charged on late payment of bills is exorbitant. There should be a more reasonable penalty, especially when the bill delivery itself is often delayed.",3,26
There are sparks coming from the main switch of the streetlight pole. It seems there is a short circuit which could lead to a fire. It needs to be repaired by a qualified electrician.,3,34
"The electricity department is not adhering to the power cut schedule they publish in the newspaper. The cuts are longer and at different times than what is announced, making the schedule useless.",3,32
Our application to shift an electricity pole that is obstructing our house entrance has been met with endless demands for bribes by the local officials. We need a way to escalate this corruption.,3,33
"The power factor of our industrial connection is low, and we are being penalized for it. However, the cause is the poor quality of power supplied by the board itself, with frequent fluctuations.",3,33
The compensation for crop damage due to a fallen electricity wire was promised but has not been paid to the farmer for over a year. The department needs to clear these dues.,3,32
The electricity infrastructure in our village is very old and weak. The wires snap even with a little wind. We are living in the 21st century but still face power cuts for days on end.,3,35
"The main street in our area, particularly the stretch near the market, is riddled with enormous potholes. It’s become a daily struggle for everyone, especially for two-wheeler riders who risk falling. During the monsoon, these holes fill with water, making them invisible and even more dangerous. We've seen several minor accidents already. We pay our road tax diligently, and we expect basic maintenance in return. The authorities need to repair this stretch of road immediately before someone gets seriously injured. It's a disaster waiting to happen and reflects poorly on the city's infrastructure management.",0,94
"The streetlights on the road connecting our colony to the main highway have not been working for over a month now. This entire stretch becomes pitch dark after sunset, which is a major safety concern for residents, especially women and elderly people returning home late. There have been a few incidents of chain snatching recently. We are living in constant fear. It’s a simple fix, but despite numerous complaints filed through the official app, no action has been taken. We urge the municipal corporation to treat this as a priority and restore the lighting.",0,94
"The traffic signal at the central crossroad has been malfunctioning for weeks. It’s stuck on a blinking yellow light, causing absolute chaos during peak hours. The traffic is unmanageable, leading to long jams and frequent arguments between drivers. It's extremely dangerous for pedestrians trying to cross the road. School children are particularly at risk. Why is there no one to fix this? A simple traffic light is crucial for maintaining order and ensuring public safety. Please dispatch a technical team to repair it before a major accident occurs here.",0,89
"The condition of the pavement along the canal road is deplorable. The concrete slabs are broken and uneven, making it impossible for people to walk without the risk of twisting an ankle. It's especially difficult for senior citizens who use this path for their morning walks. In some places, the slabs are missing entirely, exposing the drain below. This is gross negligence. A proper footpath is a basic necessity for any residential area. We request the authorities to reconstruct the pavement so that citizens can walk safely and comfortably without any fear.",0,92
"There is a massive crack that has developed right in the middle of the flyover. It seems to be getting wider every week, and you can feel a significant bump every time a vehicle passes over it. This seems like a serious structural issue that needs immediate expert attention. Ignoring it could lead to catastrophic consequences. We are not engineers, but it doesn't take an expert to see that this is a dangerous situation. We request the public works department to inspect the flyover's integrity and carry out necessary repairs urgently.",0,91
"The newly laid speed breakers in our residential area are unscientific and dangerous. They are unusually high and have no white markings, making them almost invisible at night. Several cars have scraped their undercarriage, and a few bikers have had nasty falls because they didn't spot them in time. While we appreciate the intent to control speeding, these speed bumps are doing more harm than good. They need to be redesigned to standard specifications and painted with reflective stripes for visibility. Please address this safety hazard before it causes more accidents.",0,91
"The road markings, like the zebra crossing and lane dividers, have completely faded away on the main commercial street. This creates a lot of confusion for both drivers and pedestrians. People cross the road haphazardly, and vehicles swerve between lanes. It's particularly chaotic during the evening rush. A simple coat of paint can solve this problem and significantly improve traffic discipline and safety. We ask the traffic department to take up this repainting work on an urgent basis to prevent any untoward incidents in our busy locality.",0,87
"During every slight downpour, the main intersection in front of the railway station gets severely waterlogged. The road was clearly not designed with proper drainage in mind. The stagnant water remains for days, causing immense inconvenience to commuters and damaging the road surface further. It becomes a breeding ground for mosquitoes and creates a terrible stench. This recurring problem needs a permanent solution, not just temporary fixes. The engineering department should redesign the drainage system and relay the road at a proper gradient to prevent future waterlogging.",0,87
"The streetlight pole at the corner of my street is completely rusted at the base and is leaning precariously towards the road. It looks like it could fall at any moment, especially during strong winds. It poses a grave danger to people passing by and to the houses nearby. We have tied a rope around it as a temporary measure, but it needs to be replaced immediately. We have registered a complaint online, but the status hasn't changed in over ten days. This is a critical safety issue that cannot be ignored.",0,92
"The signboards indicating street names and directions in our sector are either broken, faded, or covered by tree branches. It has become very difficult for visitors, delivery agents, and emergency services like ambulances to find the correct address. We’ve had instances where a food delivery person got lost for thirty minutes. This is more than a minor inconvenience; in a medical emergency, it could be a matter of life and death. The municipal authority should conduct a survey and install new, clear signboards throughout the area for better navigation.",0,89
"The road outside the school is in a pathetic condition. It’s just a muddy track, not a proper road. When it rains, it becomes a slushy mess, and students have to walk through muck to get to school. On dry days, the dust is a major health hazard for the children. Many requests have been made to the local representative and the city council to build a proper asphalt road here, but all our pleas have fallen on deaf ears. Our children deserve a safe and clean path to their school.",0,91
"A large portion of the road caved in last week, creating a deep sinkhole right near the bus stop. It seems to have been caused by a leaking underground pipe. Residents have placed some branches and a red cloth to warn people, but it’s a very dangerous situation, especially at night. A car or a person could easily fall into it. The authorities need to cordon off the area properly and begin repair work immediately. This is not just a road complaint; it’s an emergency that requires swift action.",0,89
"The traffic congestion under the new flyover has become worse than before. The service lanes are too narrow, and illegal parking has completely blocked one side. It takes almost twenty minutes just to cross this 500-meter stretch during office hours. The traffic police are rarely seen here to manage the situation. The entire traffic plan for this area needs to be re-evaluated. Perhaps making the service lane a one-way street could help. We need a practical solution from the traffic management department to ease this daily bottleneck.",0,87
"The reflective road studs, or cat's eyes, are missing from most of the highway stretch that passes through our town. This makes driving at night extremely difficult and dangerous, especially during foggy conditions. It's impossible to distinguish the lanes, and the risk of head-on collisions is very high. Installing these simple, low-cost safety devices can save lives. We request the national highway authority to look into this matter and replace the missing road studs as soon as possible to improve nighttime visibility and road safety for everyone.",0,87
"The pedestrian crossing button at the junction near the public library doesn't work. We have seen people, especially the elderly and children, waiting for a long time and then dangerously running across the street between fast-moving cars. A functional pedestrian signal is essential at such a busy intersection. It's a small technical glitch, but its implications for pedestrian safety are huge. Can the concerned department please send a technician to fix the button and ensure the signal is working correctly? It’s been broken for several months now.",0,87
"The condition of the access road to our apartment complex is abysmal. The builder never laid a proper tar road, and years of neglect have turned it into a dirt track full of stones and pits. Our vehicles are getting damaged, and it’s a nightmare to drive on. During the rains, it becomes completely unusable. The municipality claims it's private land, and the builder is nowhere to be found. We, the residents, are stuck in the middle. We need the local authorities to intervene and pave this road for us.",0,90
"The guardrails on the bridge over the river are broken and missing in several places. This is extremely dangerous, as a vehicle could easily lose control and plunge into the river. It's a sheer drop of about 50 feet. The bridge is used by hundreds of vehicles every day, including school buses. This is a critical safety failure that has been ignored for too long. We implore the public works department to replace the missing guardrails immediately before a tragedy occurs. The safety of commuters should be the topmost priority for the administration.",0,93
"The persistent issue of stray cattle sitting in the middle of the main road is a huge menace. They cause sudden traffic jams and are a major cause of accidents, especially at night when they are difficult to see. A friend of mine recently fractured his arm after his scooter collided with a cow. Where is the municipal cattle-catching squad? This problem has been escalating, and the authorities seem to be turning a blind eye. We need regular drives to clear the roads of stray animals to ensure commuter safety.",0,90
"The rumbler strips installed before the school zone are so aggressive that they are damaging our vehicles' suspension. They feel more like small speed breakers than warning strips. While the intention to slow down traffic is good, the design is flawed. It causes a jarring and uncomfortable ride and could even make a driver lose control. The authorities should replace these with properly designed, smoother rumbler strips that serve the purpose without causing damage or being a safety hazard themselves. A more scientific approach is needed for road safety measures.",0,90
"The overhead gantry signboard on the expressway has a spelling mistake. The name of our city is spelled incorrectly, which is not only embarrassing but also confusing for tourists and new visitors. It reflects very poorly on the administration. It's a simple thing to correct, yet it has been this way for months. How can such an error be overlooked on a major highway? We request the concerned authority to rectify this mistake at the earliest. It is a matter of our city's pride and proper public information.",0,88
"The community garbage bin in our lane is constantly overflowing. The waste spills onto the road, creating a disgusting and unhygienic environment. The smell is awful, and it's attracting a swarm of flies and stray dogs. We have requested an additional bin or more frequent collections, but nothing has been done. The collection truck comes only once in three or four days, which is not enough for our densely populated area. This is a serious health hazard, and we fear the outbreak of diseases. Please resolve this sanitation issue urgently.",1,90
"The main sewage line in our neighborhood has been blocked for over a week. Filthy, black water is overflowing from the manholes and flooding the streets. The entire area stinks, and it's impossible to even walk outside without feeling sick. We can't open our windows because of the foul odor. This is a breeding ground for all kinds of germs and diseases like cholera and typhoid. Children are especially vulnerable. We have made countless calls to the water and sewage board, but we only get empty promises. This is an emergency.",1,91
"People are openly dumping construction debris and household garbage on the empty plot next to the park. It has turned into a mini landfill. It's not only an eyesore but also a serious environmental and health problem. We've seen people setting the garbage on fire, which creates toxic smoke. The authorities need to fence this plot and put up a ‘No Dumping’ sign with a heavy penalty. Regular patrolling is also needed to catch the culprits. We need to reclaim our public spaces from such illegal activities and keep our neighborhood clean.",1,92
"The underground drainage system in our area seems to be completely choked. After a short spell of rain, the water has nowhere to go and it stagnates on the roads for days. The storm water drains are filled with silt and plastic waste. No pre-monsoon cleaning was done this year. This stagnant water is a perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes, and we are seeing a rise in cases of dengue and malaria. The health department must take immediate action to clean the drains and prevent a major health crisis.",1,89
"The public toilet near the bus stand is in a pathetic and unusable condition. There is no water supply, the doors are broken, and the stench is unbearable from a distance. It has become a spot for anti-social activities instead of serving its purpose. Women, in particular, face immense difficulty. A clean and functional public toilet is a basic necessity, not a luxury. The municipal corporation should take responsibility for its maintenance and ensure it is cleaned regularly and has a proper water supply. This is a matter of public health and dignity.",1,93
"We are facing a serious issue with biomedical waste being improperly disposed of near our homes. We often find used syringes, saline bottles, and bloody cotton swabs dumped along with regular household garbage. This is extremely hazardous and poses a significant risk of infection to the sanitation workers and the public. This waste is likely coming from a nearby clinic that is not following proper disposal protocols. The health inspector needs to investigate this matter immediately and penalize those responsible for this dangerous and illegal practice.",1,86
"The sanitation workers in our ward are not collecting garbage door-to-door as they are supposed to. They just ring a bell from the main road, and if you miss it, you are left with a pile of trash for the next day. This forces many people, especially the elderly, to dump their garbage at the street corner, creating multiple small garbage dumps. We need a more systematic and reliable collection system. The workers should be instructed to collect waste from every doorstep to ensure the locality remains clean.",1,88
"The canal that flows through our city has turned into a giant sewer. It is filled with plastic bags, industrial effluents, and raw sewage. The water is black and emits a foul smell that spreads throughout the neighboring colonies. It has become a dead water body, with no signs of aquatic life. This is a major source of pollution and disease. We need a long-term plan from the pollution control board and the city administration to clean this canal and stop the illegal discharge of waste into it. It's an environmental disaster.",1,92
There is a persistent problem of sewage water mixing with the drinking water supply in our area. The water we get from our taps often has a foul smell and a yellowish color. Many people in the neighborhood have fallen sick with stomach infections and jaundice. We are forced to buy expensive bottled water for drinking and cooking. This is a clear case of leaking sewage and water pipes that are running parallel to each other. The authorities must identify the leak and replace the old pipes on an emergency basis.,1,91
"The garbage collection vehicle in our area is not a covered one. As it moves, a lot of the trash flies out and gets scattered all over the streets. It completely defeats the purpose of cleaning. We see a trail of litter right after the truck has passed. It's an inefficient and unhygienic method of waste transportation. The municipality should deploy modern, covered compactor trucks that prevent spillage and ensure that the collected waste reaches the dumping ground without polluting the city on the way. It’s a necessary upgrade.",1,89
"A dead animal, probably a dog, has been lying on the side of the road for the past three days. It is starting to decompose, and the smell is absolutely unbearable. It's also a health hazard. We have called the municipality's helpline number multiple times, but no one has come to remove the carcass. It is a very distressing sight for everyone, especially the children. How can such a basic service be so unresponsive? We request the concerned department to please arrange for the immediate removal of the animal's body.",1,90
"The lack of public dustbins in the main market area is a huge problem. People have no option but to throw their wrappers, plastic bottles, and other small trash on the streets. The entire market looks littered and dirty by the end of the day. If the city wants to be clean, it must provide the basic infrastructure for it. Placing a sufficient number of dustbins at regular intervals would encourage people to dispose of their trash responsibly. It's a small investment that would make a big difference in maintaining cleanliness.",1,91
"The storm drain cover right in front of my house is broken. It has created a large, dangerous hole in the pavement. A child or even an adult could easily fall into it, especially at night when it's not visible. We have placed a large stone over it as a temporary warning, but we need a permanent solution. The municipal corporation needs to replace the broken slab with a new, sturdy one before someone gets seriously hurt. This is a clear safety hazard that has been neglected for weeks.",1,89
"We are facing a major problem with liquid waste being discharged from a nearby restaurant directly into our residential colony's open drain. The greasy, smelly water stagnates and attracts pests like rats and cockroaches. It’s extremely unhygienic. The restaurant should be mandated to have a proper grease trap and connect their drainage to the main sewer line, not the open surface drain. We request the health department to inspect the establishment and take strict action against this violation of sanitation norms. Our health is at stake.",1,86
"The community composting pit that was set up in our local park has been completely abandoned. It is not being managed properly and has just become another stinking pile of mixed garbage. People are throwing plastic and all sorts of non-biodegradable waste into it. The idea was good, but the execution has failed miserably. Instead of creating compost, it is creating a nuisance. The municipality either needs to revive it with proper management or remove it altogether. An unmanaged compost pit is a health hazard.",1,85
"The state of the public urinals is disgusting. They are never cleaned, there's no water, and people have stopped using them because of the filth. This forces people to relieve themselves in the open, against walls, making the entire area stink. This is a matter of public decency and hygiene. The city administration needs to ensure that these facilities are maintained properly with regular cleaning and water supply. Otherwise, their very purpose is defeated, and it contributes to the problem rather than solving it. A dedicated team for maintenance is required.",1,91
"The area under the flyover has been turned into an illegal garbage dumping ground. Every morning, we see trucks and carts coming and tipping all sorts of waste there. It includes everything from household garbage to industrial waste. The pile is growing every day, and it's a huge environmental and health concern for the thousands of people who pass by daily. The authorities must clear this dump, fence the area, and maybe beautify it to prevent this from happening again. Strict vigilance is needed to stop this illegal activity.",1,89
"Our street has not been swept by the municipal sanitation workers for over fifteen days. Layers of dust, fallen leaves, and plastic litter have accumulated everywhere. It looks like a completely neglected part of the city. We are supposed to have a sweeper assigned to our area, but he is never seen. We pay our property taxes regularly and expect basic services in return. Cleanliness is a fundamental right. We request the senior sanitation inspector to look into this matter and ensure that our street is cleaned regularly.",1,88
"The open manhole on the main road is a death trap. The cover has been missing for more than a month. It is located at a busy intersection, and anyone, especially a biker at night, could fall into it. We have tried to cover it with some branches, but a permanent solution is needed immediately. Why does it take so long for the authorities to replace a simple manhole cover? Are they waiting for a fatal accident to happen? This is criminal negligence. We demand immediate action to cover this dangerous hole.",1,92
"The segregation of waste is not happening at the source. The garbage collectors mix everything together – wet waste, dry waste, and hazardous waste. What is the point of us citizens carefully separating our garbage into different bins if it all ends up in the same truck? The entire purpose of the waste management program is defeated. The municipality needs to train its staff and provide them with compartmented vehicles to maintain segregation until the processing plant. Without this crucial step, recycling and composting efforts will never succeed.",1,88
"The children's play area in our local park is in a terrible state of disrepair. The slide has a sharp crack, the swings are rusted and have broken seats, and the merry-go-round is jammed. It has become unsafe for our kids to play there. This park is the only recreational space for children in our neighborhood. It’s heartbreaking to see it neglected like this. We request the parks and recreation department to either repair the existing equipment or install new, safe play structures for the children. Their safety should be a top priority.",2,93
"The public benches installed along the lake promenade are all broken. Most of them have broken wooden planks or rusted metal frames, making them unusable. This area is frequented by senior citizens who need a place to sit and rest during their walks. Now, they have nowhere to sit. It’s a small thing, but it greatly affects the quality of life for our elderly residents. The municipal corporation should repair or replace these benches so that people can comfortably enjoy this beautiful public space. It’s a basic amenity that needs attention.",2,91
"The public water tap in the market has been dry for months. This tap was a vital source of drinking water for hundreds of vendors, rickshaw pullers, and shoppers every day. Now, they are forced to buy expensive bottled water. In a hot climate like ours, access to free, safe drinking water is a fundamental necessity. The authorities should investigate the reason for the disruption in the water supply and restore it immediately. It's a matter of public service and basic human rights to have access to drinking water.",2,89
"The bus stop shelter near the college has a broken roof and no seating. During the heavy rains, it offers no protection, and students get drenched while waiting for the bus. On sunny days, there is no shade. It’s just a useless structure. A proper bus shelter is essential for the comfort and safety of commuters. We request the transport department to repair the roof and install benches at this busy bus stop. It would be a great help to the thousands of students and other passengers who use it daily.",2,91
"The community hall in our sector is in a state of utter neglect. The windows are broken, the walls are covered in damp patches, and the toilets are filthy. This hall was built for public functions and community gatherings, but its current condition makes it unfit for any use. It has been locked up for years and is now being used by vagrants. We urge the authorities to renovate the community hall and make it functional again. It is a valuable public asset that is currently going to waste due to lack of maintenance.",2,94
"The floodlights at the public sports ground are not working. This forces the youngsters to stop playing as soon as it gets dark in the evening. The ground, which was once a hub of activity, becomes deserted after 6 PM. Having functional lighting would extend the playing hours and allow more people, especially those who work during the day, to use the facility for sports and exercise. We request the concerned department to repair the floodlights and promote a healthy and active lifestyle among the youth. It's an investment in community health.",2,92
"The condition of the public library has deteriorated significantly. There is a shortage of chairs, many of the fans and lights do not work, and the building itself is in dire need of a paint job. The collection of books has not been updated in years. This library is an important resource for students and avid readers in our area who cannot afford to buy new books. We request the education department to allocate funds for the renovation and modernization of our public library. It's a crucial center for learning and knowledge.",2,92
"The walking track in the city's main park is in a terrible condition. It is full of cracks and uneven surfaces, making it dangerous for joggers and walkers. We have seen several elderly people trip and fall. The track is also poorly lit, making it unsafe for use in the early mornings or late evenings. A well-maintained walking track is essential for promoting fitness among citizens. We ask the horticulture department to relay the track with a proper surface and install adequate lighting along its entire length for safety.",2,89
"The public swimming pool, which is the only one in our part of the town, has been closed for the entire summer season. There has been no communication from the authorities about why it is closed or when it will reopen. This is a huge disappointment for the hundreds of children and adults who use this facility to beat the heat and for exercise. We request the sports authority to provide a clear update and take the necessary steps to make the pool operational at the earliest. It is a much-needed recreational facility.",2,93
"The fence around the local park is broken in several places. This allows stray dogs to enter the park, which is a nuisance and a safety concern for the children and walkers. The dogs often chase people and litter the area. A proper, intact fence is necessary to maintain the park as a safe and clean space for residents. We request the municipality to repair the boundary fence on a priority basis. This simple measure will significantly improve the experience for everyone who uses the park for relaxation and recreation.",2,90
The water fountain installed in the central plaza has been non-functional for years. It has now become a stagnant pool of dirty water and a breeding ground for mosquitoes. What was supposed to be a beautiful landmark is now an ugly eyesore and a health hazard. The authorities should either repair the fountain and make it operational or dismantle it and convert the space into a flower bed. Leaving it in its current state of neglect is the worst possible option for our city's main public square.,2,87
"The public toilets built for women are always locked. We see these pink-colored structures at various places in the city, but they are never open for use. This is a huge problem for women who are out for work or shopping. It defeats the entire purpose of building them. If they have been constructed, why are they not functional? The municipal corporation needs to ensure that these toilets are opened, staffed with a female attendant, and maintained properly. This is a critical issue of women's safety and hygiene.",2,88
"The ramp for wheelchair access at the government office building is too steep and has no handrails. It is practically impossible for a person with a disability to use it without assistance. This is a violation of the accessibility norms and shows a lack of sensitivity towards differently-abled citizens. All public buildings should be fully accessible. We request the authorities to reconstruct the ramp according to the prescribed standards, with a gentle slope and proper railings, to ensure barrier-free access for everyone. It's a matter of inclusivity.",2,87
"The local gymnasium, run by the municipality, has outdated and broken equipment. Many of the weight machines are rusted, and the treadmills are often out of order. This facility is a great asset for people who cannot afford expensive private gyms. However, the lack of maintenance is putting people off. We request the authorities to invest in new equipment and carry out regular maintenance to make the gym a safe and effective place for fitness enthusiasts. A small investment can have a big impact on public health.",2,87
"The signage and information boards in the city botanical garden are in a terrible state. The names of the plants are either faded or the boards are broken. It’s difficult for visitors, especially students, to learn about the different plant species. A botanical garden is supposed to be an educational space. We suggest that the garden management install new, weather-proof information plaques with details about the plants. This would greatly enhance the educational value and visitor experience of this beautiful public amenity.",2,82
"The designated area for street vendors near the metro station is completely lacking in basic facilities. There is no provision for waste disposal, no access to clean water, and no public toilets nearby. As a result, the area has become very unhygienic. These vendors provide an essential service to commuters, and they deserve a clean and organized space to conduct their business. The authorities should develop the vending zone with these basic amenities to ensure public health and a more organized market environment for everyone.",2,85
"The free public Wi-Fi service that was launched with much fanfare in the city center is a complete failure. It rarely ever connects, and even when it does, the speed is too slow to even open a webpage. This is a classic case of a good initiative being ruined by poor implementation and lack of maintenance. If the city is going to provide a public service, it should ensure that it works reliably. We request the IT department to look into the technical issues and make the public Wi-Fi a functional and useful amenity.",2,94
"The basketball court in our community park is unusable. The surface is cracked, and the hoops are bent and have no nets. The youth of our neighborhood who are interested in the sport have nowhere to play. We have a lot of talented players here, but they are being discouraged by the lack of a proper facility. We request the sports department to resurface the court and install new hoops and nets. This would provide a healthy outlet for the energy of our young people and promote sports in the community.",2,91
"The parking area designated for the public at the main market is just a dusty, uneven plot of land. There are no marked bays, no lighting, and no security. It's a chaotic mess, and people park their vehicles haphazardly, often blocking others. This leads to frequent disputes. The municipality, which charges a parking fee here, should at least provide a properly paved surface with marked parking spaces and adequate lighting. This would bring some order and safety to the parking situation and make visiting the market a more pleasant experience.",2,90
"The community garden has become overgrown with weeds and is completely neglected. The water connection has been cut, and the plants are dying. This garden was started by residents with great enthusiasm, but it needs support from the horticulture department for maintenance. It's a beautiful green space that helps improve the local environment and provides a place for community interaction. We request the authorities to restore the water supply and assign a gardener to help the residents maintain this valuable public asset. We don't want to lose this green lung.",2,90
"We are experiencing frequent and unscheduled power cuts in our area every single day. The electricity goes off for hours without any prior notification. This is causing huge problems for everyone, especially for students studying for exams and people working from home. Our electronic appliances are also getting damaged due to the voltage fluctuations when the power returns. We have been paying our bills regularly, and we deserve a stable and reliable power supply. The electricity department needs to provide a reason for these cuts and find a permanent solution.",3,90
"The electricity transformer in our colony is constantly overloaded. It makes a loud buzzing noise, and we often see sparks coming out of it, especially during the evening when the load is high. We are living in fear of a major fire or an explosion. The transformer is old and not sufficient for the number of new houses that have come up in the area. We request the power company to install a new, higher-capacity transformer to ensure the safety of the residents. This is an urgent request as it concerns our lives.",3,93
"There are several low-hanging electrical wires on our street. They are dangling dangerously close to the buildings and can be easily touched by a person from a balcony or a terrace. During the rains, the situation becomes even more precarious. This is a serious safety hazard and a tragedy waiting to happen. We have complained to the local electricity office multiple times, but no one has come to fix the issue. The wires need to be re-laid at a safe height immediately before they cause a fatal accident.",3,88
"The electricity pole right outside my house is in a dilapidated condition. It is made of concrete, but it has developed a large crack at the base and is leaning to one side. We are worried that it might fall on our house during a storm or heavy rain. It supports a lot of heavy cables and a transformer, which makes it even more dangerous. The electricity board should inspect the pole and replace it on an urgent basis. We cannot sleep peacefully at night because of this constant threat.",3,90
"We have been facing a severe low voltage problem in our locality for the past few months. The lights are always dim, and the fans move at a very slow speed. We cannot use our appliances like air conditioners or water pumps properly. This is happening even when there is no power cut. It seems to be a problem with the main supply line or the local transformer. We request the engineers from the electricity department to investigate the cause of the low voltage and rectify the problem as soon as possible.",3,92
"The streetlights in our neighborhood are on during the daytime. They are blazing in the bright sunlight, which is a criminal waste of electricity. At the same time, we are subjected to long power cuts. This is a clear case of mismanagement. The automatic timer or sensor that is supposed to control these lights is obviously faulty. The authorities should fix this system to conserve energy and ensure that electricity is used judiciously. This needs immediate attention from the maintenance department of the power corporation.",3,85
"The new digital electricity meter that was installed at my home is faulty. It is running too fast, and my electricity bill for the last month has been three times the usual amount, even though our consumption pattern has not changed. I suspect the meter is recording incorrect readings. I have lodged a complaint for a meter check, but the process is very slow. I request the electricity company to send a technician to inspect and, if necessary, replace the faulty meter. I cannot afford to pay such inflated bills.",3,90
"There is a bunch of tangled wires from various service providers like cable TV, internet, and telephone, all hanging haphazardly from the electricity poles. This creates a very ugly and cluttered look, often referred to as a 'wire spaghetti'. More importantly, it is a fire hazard. A short circuit in any of these wires could lead to a major fire, affecting the main power lines. The electricity company and the municipality should enforce proper guidelines for laying these cables through underground ducts or organized casings.",3,85
"The electricity department is conducting tree trimming work in a very unprofessional manner. They are hacking the branches indiscriminately, which is destroying the green cover of our colony. While we understand the need to trim branches near power lines for safety, it should be done scientifically, without harming the tree. We request that the department use trained personnel for this job and work in coordination with the horticulture department to ensure the health of the trees is preserved while maintaining the safety of the power lines.",3,86
"After a recent storm, a live electricity wire has snapped and fallen on the road. It is lying in a puddle of water, and sparks are coming from it. This is an extremely dangerous situation. We have tried to warn people and have blocked the area with some stones, but a permanent solution is needed immediately. We have been trying to reach the emergency helpline of the power department, but the number is continuously busy. We need an emergency response team to come and disconnect the power and repair the wire immediately.",3,92
"The road leading to the industrial area is a complete nightmare for commuters. It hasn't been repaired in years and is full of deep potholes. It causes significant damage to our vehicles and slows down the movement of goods. During the rainy season, it becomes a slushy, muddy track. This poor infrastructure affects the local businesses and is a deterrent for new investment. We urge the authorities to prioritize the resurfacing of this crucial economic artery. A good road is essential for the smooth functioning of the industries located here.",0,90
"The newly installed LED streetlights in our lane are too bright and are positioned incorrectly. The light shines directly into our windows, making it difficult for us to sleep at night. It's a constant disturbance. While we appreciate the move to energy-efficient lighting, the implementation is flawed. The angle of the lights needs to be adjusted so that they illuminate the street and not our homes. We request the concerned department to look into this issue of light pollution and make the necessary adjustments to the fixtures for the comfort of the residents.",0,93
"The pedestrian bridge over the railway tracks is in a very dangerous condition. The concrete steps are broken, and the iron railings are rusted and have come off at several points. It's used by hundreds of people daily, including school children, to cross the tracks safely. The structure feels unstable and sways when many people are on it. We fear it might collapse one day. The railway authorities or the municipal corporation needs to conduct a structural audit and carry out urgent repairs before a disaster happens. Public safety cannot be compromised.",0,92
"There is no proper signage or warning on the highway about the sharp, blind curve ahead. There have been numerous accidents at this spot, especially involving vehicles coming at high speed. A simple solution would be to install large warning signs, reflective markers, and rumbler strips well before the curve to alert drivers to slow down. The traffic police department should inspect this accident-prone spot and implement these safety measures immediately. It's a proactive step that could save many lives and prevent future accidents from occurring at this dangerous location.",0,90
The bicycle lane that was created a few years ago has been completely encroached upon by street vendors and for illegal parking. It's impossible for cyclists to use it. The lane is also poorly maintained and has potholes. The whole purpose of promoting a green mode of transport has been defeated. The authorities need to clear the encroachments and ensure that the lane is reserved exclusively for cyclists. Regular patrolling is required to prevent re-encroachment. We need to reclaim our cycling infrastructure and encourage a healthier lifestyle.,0,87
"The road surface on the main bridge has become dangerously smooth and slippery, especially during the rains. The anti-skid layer seems to have worn off completely. We have seen several two-wheelers skid and fall while trying to brake. This is a serious hazard that needs immediate attention. The public works department should apply a new anti-skid coating to the road surface to ensure better grip and prevent such accidents. The safety of the thousands of commuters who use this bridge every day is at stake.",0,85
"The storm drains along the side of the road are not covered. These open gutters are a safety hazard, especially for children playing in the street and for pedestrians at night. They are also filled with garbage and stagnant water, which leads to mosquito breeding. It's a simple civic issue that has been ignored for a long time. The municipality should cover these drains with concrete slabs to ensure pedestrian safety and improve the overall hygiene of the neighborhood. It would make our streets safer and cleaner.",0,87
"The traffic island at the center of the roundabout is completely neglected. It's just a patch of dirt with overgrown weeds. It could be turned into a beautiful green space with a small garden or a fountain, which would improve the aesthetics of the entire area. A well-maintained roundabout also helps in guiding traffic more effectively. We request the horticulture department of the city corporation to take up the beautification of this traffic island. It would be a small but significant step towards making our city more beautiful.",0,88
"The road that was dug up by the water department to lay new pipes has not been repaired properly. They have just filled the trench with loose mud and gravel. It's been over two months now. The road is uneven, and it's a very bumpy ride. The loose soil also creates a lot of dust. There seems to be no coordination between different government departments. The road construction department should ensure that any agency that digs up a road is responsible for restoring it to its original condition immediately after the work is completed.",0,94
"The lack of a designated parking area in the main market is causing traffic chaos. People park their cars and bikes on the road, which narrows the space for moving traffic and leads to constant gridlock. Finding a parking spot is a major headache for shoppers. The municipality should identify a suitable plot of land nearby and develop a multi-level parking facility. This would ease congestion, reduce pollution from idling vehicles, and make the market area more accessible and pleasant for everyone. It's a much-needed long-term solution.",0,87
"A large garbage dump has been created on the bank of the river, just outside the city. People are throwing all kinds of waste, including plastics and chemicals, directly into the river. This is poisoning our main source of drinking water and destroying the aquatic ecosystem. The pollution control board seems to be asleep. We need immediate intervention to stop this illegal dumping and to clean up the existing mess. Strict penalties should be imposed on those who are found polluting our precious water resources. This is an environmental crime.",1,90
"The community waste collection center is not being managed properly. The waste is not segregated, and it is left in the open, creating a foul smell and attracting pests. The purpose of this center was to facilitate recycling and proper waste management, but it has become a source of pollution itself. The staff needs to be trained on proper segregation and composting techniques. The center should be kept clean and organized. Otherwise, it will lose the trust of the residents, and people will go back to dumping their garbage on the streets.",1,92
"The problem of medical waste being mixed with household garbage continues unabashed. Every day, we find used masks, gloves, and sometimes even syringes in the public dustbin. This is incredibly dangerous for the sanitation workers who handle this waste with their bare hands. It also poses a huge risk of spreading infections. The local clinics and hospitals need to be audited to ensure they are following the strict protocols for biomedical waste disposal. The health authorities must take this matter very seriously and enforce the law strictly.",1,87
"The drains in our colony are never cleaned. They are choked with silt, plastic bags, and other waste. As a result, even a small amount of rain causes the dirty water to overflow onto the roads and into our homes. We are living in unhygienic conditions. The stagnant water is a breeding ground for mosquitoes, and the risk of diseases like dengue and chikungunya is very high. We demand that the municipal corporation carry out a thorough de-silting of the drains before the monsoon season arrives. This should be a routine annual activity.",1,93
"The street corners in our neighborhood have been turned into unofficial garbage dumping spots. People find it convenient to throw their trash bags here at night. These piles of garbage are an eyesore and a health hazard. The municipal corporation should clean these spots, and perhaps beautify them with some plants or a small painting on the wall to discourage people from dumping again. We also need stricter enforcement and penalties for those who are caught littering. A clean neighborhood is a shared responsibility of both citizens and the administration.",1,90
"The system for collecting hazardous household waste like used batteries, expired medicines, and broken electronic items is non-existent. People have no option but to throw them in with the regular trash. These items contain toxic chemicals that leach into the soil and water when they end up in a landfill. The city needs to set up designated collection points or organize periodic collection drives for e-waste and other hazardous materials to ensure they are disposed of safely and responsibly. It’s crucial for environmental protection.",1,84
"The garbage truck that services our area is very irregular. There is no fixed schedule, and sometimes it doesn't come for three or four days in a row. This forces us to store stinking garbage in our homes or dump it on the street. We need a reliable and predictable garbage collection service. The municipality should publish a fixed schedule for each area and ensure that the trucks adhere to it. Using a GPS tracking system on the vehicles could also help in monitoring their movement and ensuring accountability.",1,89
"The public toilet at the main bus terminal is being run by a private contractor who charges an exorbitant fee for its use. Moreover, the toilet is poorly maintained and is always dirty. Access to clean sanitation facilities should be affordable and hygienic. The municipal corporation should regulate the fees charged for the use of public toilets and ensure that the contractors maintain them to a certain standard of cleanliness. They should conduct surprise inspections to check the conditions. Public amenities should not be a means for exploitation.",1,88
"There is a huge problem with the disposal of waste from coconut vendors. They just dump the shells and other waste on the roadside, which attracts flies and creates a mess. The municipal corporation should designate specific disposal points for such vendors and ensure that they clean up their space at the end of the day. This type of trade waste needs special attention as it is voluminous and can clog drains. A little bit of regulation and enforcement can solve this problem and keep our streets clean.",1,88
"The campaign for waste segregation at source has failed in our area due to a lack of follow-through from the authorities. We diligently separate our wet and dry waste, but the collection workers mix it all up in the same truck. This is very demotivating for the residents. If the government wants citizens to participate, it must first get its own collection and processing system in order. Providing separate compartments in the collection vehicles is the first basic step that is missing. We need a system that respects the efforts of the citizens.",1,93
"The equipment in the open-air gym in our park is broken and has become a safety hazard. A piece of the leg press machine is jutting out with a sharp edge, and the pull-up bar is loose. These gyms are a wonderful initiative for public health, but they need regular maintenance. An injury caused by faulty equipment would be a major setback. We request the concerned department to conduct a safety inspection of all the equipment and repair or replace the broken parts immediately. The well-being of the users is paramount.",2,91
"The public drinking water cooler installed at the city park is not working. It's been out of order for the entire summer. People, especially children and the elderly who come to the park, have no access to drinking water. They are forced to buy plastic water bottles, which adds to the litter problem. Providing access to safe drinking water in public spaces is a basic service that the municipality should ensure. We request the authorities to repair the water cooler as soon as possible. It's a small but important amenity for the public.",2,93
"The reading room at the public library is always overcrowded, and there are not enough chairs and tables for everyone. Many students who come here to study for competitive exams have to sit on the floor or go back home. The library needs to be expanded, or at least, the existing space should be utilized more efficiently with better furniture. We request the administration to look into this issue and provide adequate infrastructure for the aspiring students of our city. A good study environment is essential for their success.",2,89
"The public notification board in the center of the town, which is meant for displaying important public notices and information, is in a state of neglect. It is covered with old, torn posters and unauthorized advertisements. The glass cover is broken, and it is not locked. It is not serving its purpose of communicating official information to the citizens. The local administration should repair this board and ensure that it is used only for its intended purpose. It can be a vital tool for public communication if maintained properly.",2,89
"The boat club at the city lake, which is a popular recreational facility, has very poor safety standards. They do not provide proper life jackets for everyone, and the ones they have are old and torn. The boats themselves seem poorly maintained. We are concerned about the safety of the people who go for boating here. The authorities should conduct a safety audit of the boat club and enforce strict safety regulations, including the mandatory use of certified life jackets for all. Safety should be the number one priority in such recreational activities.",2,93
"The designated space for senior citizens in the community park is not well-maintained. The benches are broken, and the area is not shaded properly from the sun. It's also not kept clean. Our elders deserve a comfortable and clean space where they can relax and socialize. We request the park authorities to install new benches, plant some shade-giving trees, and ensure the area is cleaned regularly. It would be a small gesture of respect and care for the senior members of our community who have contributed so much.",2,88
"The public art installation, a beautiful sculpture in the main city square, is covered in dust and bird droppings. It has not been cleaned or maintained in years. What was once a piece of beauty that instilled civic pride is now a symbol of neglect. Public art needs to be maintained to preserve its aesthetic value. We request the city's cultural department to arrange for the regular cleaning and maintenance of this and other public art installations across the city. Let's not allow our cultural assets to decay.",2,88
"The public announcement system at the central bus station is not working properly. The announcements are often unclear, and sometimes the system doesn't work at all. This causes a lot of confusion for passengers, especially those who are from out of town or are illiterate. They miss their buses and have to face a lot of hardship. A clear and functional public address system is a basic requirement for any transport hub. The transport authorities should repair or upgrade the system to ensure smooth communication with the passengers.",2,88
"The tourist information center located near the historical monument is always closed. Tourists who visit our city have no place to get authentic information, maps, or guidance. This reflects very poorly on our city's tourism management. The center should be staffed and kept open during visiting hours. It can play a crucial role in promoting tourism and providing a better experience for visitors. We request the tourism department to make this facility functional and help visitors explore our city's heritage in a more organized way.",2,85
"The fire hydrants in our commercial area seem to be non-functional. They are rusted, and some are even blocked by illegal constructions. In case of a fire emergency, the fire brigade will not have access to a ready source of water. This is a massive safety risk for the entire market. The fire department and the municipality should conduct a survey of all the fire hydrants in the city, ensure they are in working condition, and remove any encroachments around them. This is a critical piece of emergency infrastructure that cannot be neglected.",2,93
"The power supply to the streetlights is erratic. On some nights, the lights don't come on at all, plunging the entire street into darkness. On other days, as I've seen today, they remain on well into the afternoon. This inconsistency suggests a problem with the automated control system. It's not only a safety concern during the nights but also a significant waste of precious electricity during the day. We request the power distribution company to inspect the system and ensure it functions reliably, turning the lights on at dusk and off at dawn.",3,93
"A new high-rise building is being constructed in our area, and the electricity load has increased significantly. However, the old transformer has not been upgraded. As a result, we are facing frequent tripping and low voltage issues, especially in the evenings. Our appliances are at risk of getting damaged. The power company should have planned for this and upgraded the infrastructure before giving the new connection. We request them to install a transformer with adequate capacity to handle the increased load and provide a stable power supply to all residents.",3,90
"The electricity bill that we received this month is completely inaccurate. It shows a consumption of 2000 units, whereas our average consumption is around 300 units. There is clearly a mistake in the meter reading or the billing process. We have tried to contact customer service, but the waiting times are too long. We cannot pay this exorbitant amount. We request the electricity company to re-check the meter reading and issue a corrected bill immediately. This kind of error causes a lot of stress and financial hardship for the consumers.",3,90
"The insulation on the main power cable passing through our street has worn off in several places, and the live wires are exposed. This is extremely dangerous, especially since the cable passes over a children's play area. A bird or a monkey could cause a short circuit, or the wire could snap and fall. We have been living with this fear for months. The electricity company needs to replace this old, damaged cable with a new, properly insulated one on an emergency basis. The safety of our children is at stake.",3,91
"During the recent thunderstorm, the power supply to our entire block was cut off. While the power has been restored to all other areas, our block is still in darkness for the past 48 hours. We have made numerous calls to the helpline, and each time we are told that the team is working on it. We are running out of drinking water as the water pumps are not working. Our food in the refrigerator has spoiled. We need the electricity department to give us a clear timeline for restoration and expedite the repair work.",3,95
"The process for applying for a new electricity connection is very cumbersome and slow. We have submitted all the required documents three months ago, but the file has not moved. The officials keep asking for new documents, and there is no transparency in the process. We are building a new house and are unable to proceed with the work due to the lack of a power connection. We request the senior management of the power company to simplify the process and set a clear timeline for providing new connections. This delay is causing a lot of harassment.",3,97
"The employees of the electricity department who come for meter reading are very unprofessional. They often come at odd hours without any prior information, and their behavior is rude. Sometimes, they just write an average reading without even checking the meter, which leads to incorrect bills. There should be a proper system where the meter readers have a fixed schedule, wear a uniform, and carry an identity card. They should be trained to be courteous and professional in their dealings with the customers. This would improve the company's image.",3,89
"The voltage in our area is consistently very high, often going above 250 volts. This is causing our electrical appliances to burn out. In the last month, we have lost a television and a microwave due to this high voltage. It is a serious problem that is causing us financial losses. The electricity board is responsible for providing power at a safe and stable voltage. We request them to install a voltage regulator at the local substation to control the voltage and protect our valuable appliances from further damage.",3,89
"There is a proposal to install a high-tension power line right over our residential colony. This is a huge health and safety concern for all the residents. The electromagnetic radiation from these lines is believed to have adverse health effects. Moreover, the risk of a wire snapping and falling is always there. We strongly object to this proposal. The power company should find an alternative route for the high-tension line that does not pass over populated areas. The well-being of the citizens should be given priority over convenience.",3,88
"The customer service helpline of the electricity department is a complete disaster. It is always busy, and if you are lucky enough to get through, the staff is clueless and unhelpful. They cannot provide any clear information about power cuts or billing issues. They just register a complaint, but there is no follow-up. In this digital age, we expect a more efficient and responsive customer service system. The company should invest in training its staff and upgrading its call center technology to provide better support to its consumers.",3,88
"Sir, the road in front of our colony gate having big pothole. The top bitumen layer is gone, only stone aggregate is visible. Pothole size is 3 feet diameter and maybe 4 inch deep. When car pass, water splash on us. Two wheeler have risk of skidding. This road was made only 1 year before. Very bad quality work. Requesting to please do the patching work on urgent basis. It is very dangerous for night driving also. Many vehicle getting damaged everyday.",0,82
The traffic light at main crossroad is not working properly since one week. It is only blinking yellow light all the time. There is too much traffic jam and confusion. People are shouting and fighting. No traffic police is there to control. Very risky for children to cross road for school. The timer unit or the controller card may be having fault. Please send technical person to repair this signal system immediately before major accident.,0,75
"Streetlight pole number KH-245 is leaning too much. It is old iron pole, base is having full rust. I think it will fall in heavy wind or rain. The wire is also very low. It can fall on some person or car. This is very serious safety issue. We have complaint before also but no action. Please replace this pole immediately. We are living with fear. It is right in front of my house. Please do needful.",0,77
"The paver blocks on footpath are broken and dislocated. It is impossible to walk for old people. My mother almost fell yesterday. The level is not proper, water is collecting in many place. This is near the main market where many people walk. The base sand is also washed away. Whole footpath need relaying work with proper compaction. Kindly look into this matter for pedestrian safety.",0,66
"Road marking like zebra crossing and lane divider is fully faded. We cannot see anything in night. It is very difficult to know where to cross road. For driving also it is confusing, no lane discipline. This need urgent repainting with thermoplastic paint for long life. This is very busy road with high speed traffic. A small thing like road marking can save life. Please take action.",0,67
"The new speed breaker they have put is like a wall. It is too much high and no white paint also. My car bottom part hit very badly two times. It is not as per IRC standard design. A speed breaker should slow down vehicle, not break them. Many scooter are also falling. Please make its height less or rebuild it with proper slope. It is a hazard for us. Immediate action is needed.",0,74
Water logging problem on this street is every year story. The road level is lower than the drains. So all rain water collect on road. It takes 3-4 days for water to go. Very bad smell and mosquito problem. The road surface is also getting damaged due to this water. The road need to be rebuilt with proper camber and higher level. Also the storm water drain need cleaning. Permanent solution is required.,0,73
The sodium vapour lamp in our street is always flickering. It is very irritating for eyes. And brightness is also very low. We are not able to see clearly in night.

This is complaint for streetlight number S-56.,0,65
The manhole cover on the middle of the road is broken. It is cast iron cover but it is cracked in two piece. A bike tyre can get stuck inside. It is very very dangerous.

Road is sinking near the corner. It seems some underground pipe is leaking. A big depression has formed and cracks are coming all around. I am afraid a big sinkhole will form here. We can feel vibration when heavy truck pass. The PWD department should check this urgently. Maybe they need to use ground penetrating radar to see what is problem below. This is serious structural issue.,0,67
"The iron railing on the side of the bridge is completely rusted. Many section are missing also. It is very unsafe for people who are walking on bridge. Especially for children. If someone falls, they will go directly in river. This is criminal negligence. The old railing should be removed and new stainless steel or painted MS railing should be installed. Safety must be priority.",0,65
"There is too much dust on the road because no mechanical sweeping is done. The dust is causing breathing problem for us. Our house is always full of dust. When vehicle go fast, it is like a dust storm. This is a big health hazard. The municipality must do regular mechanical sweeping and water sprinkling on this road. We are suffering very much due to this pollution.",0,67
The cat's eye reflectors on the road divider are all broken. Driving in the night is very difficult. We cannot see the divider properly. This is very dangerous on highway part. Many accident have happened because of this. Please install new 3M quality road studs for better night visibility. This is very important for safety of commuters. It will not cost much but save lives.,0,65
"The bus shelter is there but road in front is full of potholes. When bus comes, it cannot stop properly. And when it rains, the whole area become muddy. Old people have problem to get in bus. The road surface at the bus bay needs to be repaired with concrete for durability. This will make it easy for bus to stop and people to board. Please look into this small issue.",0,71
The concrete road surface is having many cracks. The top layer is peeling off. The steel reinforcement is visible in some places. This is called spalling of concrete. The quality of material used was very bad. This road will not last long. The contractor should be held responsible. An inquiry should be done. And immediate repair work is needed to prevent further damage.,0,63
The traffic signal timer is not working correct. The green light is only for 10 second and red light is for 2 minutes. This is causing very long traffic jam on our side. The traffic flow is not balanced. The signal timing needs to be reprogrammed based on the traffic volume study. Please send engineer from traffic department to check and correct this. Daily we are wasting 30 minutes here.,0,70
The gully trap grating on the side of road is stolen. Now there is a big open hole. It is very dangerous for pedestrian. And all garbage is going inside the drain and blocking it. This is happening again and again. I suggest to install new gratings and weld them with the frame so it cannot be stolen. This is better solution. Please take necessary action to cover this hole.,0,70
The road is too narrow and there is encroachment from both side. Shops have put their things on road. There is no space for walking. And traffic is always jam. The municipality should do anti-encroachment drive and make the road wide. We need proper footpath for walking. This is very old problem but no one is taking action. It is becoming very difficult to live here.,0,66
"The warning board for 'School Ahead' is covered by tree branches. No one can see it. So people are driving very fast in school zone. This is very risky for the safety of our children. The municipality garden department should trim the branches of the tree. Also, the sign board should be of reflective material so it is visible in night also. Please coordinate and get it done.",0,68
"All the garbage is overflowing from the dustbin. The size of bin is too small for our area. We need bigger container, maybe 1100 litre capacity. The garbage collection truck is also not coming daily. It comes after 2 or 3 days. The smell is very bad and many stray dogs are there. This is big hygiene problem. Please provide bigger bin and make collection service regular.",1,67
The main sewer line is blocked. All dirty water from toilet is overflowing from manhole. The whole street is flooded with sewage. We cannot even go out of our house. The smell is unbearable. We are afraid of diseases like cholera. Please send emergency team with jetting machine to clear this sewer blockage. This is happening for 3 days now. Very pathetic situation.,1,63
"People are throwing construction waste and debris in the night on empty plot. It has become a big dump yard. It is creating dust pollution and is very ugly to see. Also, some people are burning the waste which makes toxic smoke. The municipality should put a big board of 'No Dumping, Penalty Rs 5000'. Also, they should catch the people who are doing this. The plot should be cleaned.",1,70
"The storm water drain is full of plastic bags and silt. No pre-monsoon desilting work was done this year. If there is heavy rain, our area will be flooded for sure. The water has no place to go. This is pure negligence from the authority. We request you to please start the cleaning of all main drains on priority. Otherwise we will suffer a lot in rainy season.",1,68
"The public toilet near railway station is very very dirty. There is no water, no light. The urinal pots are broken. No one can use it. People are urinating in open outside. This is making the whole area stink. The contractor is taking money but not doing any cleaning. Please do surprise inspection and take strict action. A clean public toilet is a basic need.",1,65
"We are finding used syringe and medical waste in our regular garbage bin. This is very dangerous for the garbage collector and for us. Some nearby clinic or hospital is throwing this bio-medical waste illegally. This can spread serious diseases like HIV, Hepatitis. The health department should investigate all clinics in this area and find out who is doing this. This is a criminal act.",1,65
The door to door garbage collection is not happening properly. The person just come on main road and rings bell. For old people living inside lane it is not possible to come out every time. So garbage is left in house. We need a proper system where the collector goes to every house. This will make our colony truly clean. Please instruct the sanitation staff for this.,1,67
The small canal passing through our area is now a 'nalla'. All sewage and industrial chemical is going inside. The water is black and has very foul smell. It has become breeding ground for mosquitos. The ground water is also getting polluted. The Pollution Control Board should take sample and take action against factories who are releasing chemical waste. This is destroying our environment.,1,64
The drinking water we get has sewage smell. Sometime we get dirty yellow water. We think the water pipeline and sewage line are leaking and getting mixed up. Many people in our area got stomach infection. We are forced to buy mineral water which is very costly. The water supply department must check the pipeline and replace the old leaking pipes. This is a serious health issue.,1,67
"The garbage truck which comes for collection is open top. When it moves, all light garbage like plastic bag flies and spreads on road. The cleaning work is undone. The municipality should use modern covered compactor trucks. This will prevent the garbage from spilling. It is more hygienic and efficient method. We need to upgrade our waste management system. Please consider this suggestion.",1,63
A dead cow is lying on the roadside for 2 days. The body is swelling and very bad smell is coming. It is a big traffic problem also. We have called the helpline many times. They say they will come but nobody has come. It is very unhygienic. The carcass disposal team should come and remove it immediately. This is very bad service from the municipality.,1,66
"There are no dustbins in the entire market area. People eat and throw the plates and wrappers on the road. The whole market looks very dirty. If there are dustbins at every 50 meter, people will use them. It is a simple solution to keep the market clean. We request the authority to install at least 20 new steel dustbins in the main market. This will help in Swachh Bharat mission.",1,71
"The RCC slab on the top of the drain is broken. There is a big hole of 2 feet by 2 feet. My son's leg went inside it yesterday. He got hurt.

I have attached photo of the broken slab.",1,77
The liquid waste from a nearby dairy is flowing into our open drain. It is full of milk residue and is very smelly. It is attracting many flies and insects. This is not allowed. They should have their own effluent treatment plant. We request the health inspector to visit this dairy and give them notice. We are tired of this daily problem. It is causing lot of nuisance.,1,68
"The community compost pit is not working. People are throwing all kind of mixed waste in it, including plastic. It is not making compost, it is just a stinking garbage pile. The municipality should educate people how to use it. Only wet kitchen waste should be put. Or the municipality should manage it themselves. Right now, it is a failed project and a health hazard.",1,65
The public urinal is leaking from the back side. All the urine is collecting on the footpath. It is very disgusting to walk from there. The smell is also very strong. The flush is not working inside. The water connection needs to be repaired. The plumbing work is of very poor quality. Please send a plumber to fix the leakage and the flush system. The whole place needs to be sanitized.,1,71
"Under the flyover, it has become an illegal dumping spot for garbage. The pillars of the flyover are getting damaged. It is also a fire risk. The structural safety of the flyover can be affected. The authority should put a fence or a wall to stop people from throwing garbage there. They can also do some beautification like painting or small garden. This will solve the problem permanently.",1,68
The sweeper assigned for our street is not coming for duty. He is absent for last 10 days. The street is full of leaves and dust. We are paying tax for this service. This is not fair. We want regular sweeping of our street. Please take action against the absent employee and send a substitute sweeper. We have his name and number. His supervisor is also not responding to our calls.,1,71
"The manhole cover is not fitting properly. When any vehicle goes over it, it makes a loud 'thud' noise. The whole night we cannot sleep because of this noise. It is very disturbing. The cover is rocking. Maybe the frame is broken or the cover is of wrong size. Please fix this problem. We need some peace. The noise is constant, every minute some vehicle is passing.",1,67
We are separating our garbage in wet and dry bins. But the garbage collector is mixing them in one container. What is the use of our effort? The whole idea of segregation is failing. The municipality should provide two compartment truck. They should also train the staff about importance of segregation. Otherwise people will stop doing it. Please implement the system properly.,1,62
The park's swing chain is having rusted link. It is looking very weak. I am afraid it will break when my child is swinging. This is very big safety risk. The park keeper is not listening. The whole swing set is very old. It should be inspected by an engineer. Please replace the chain with new galvanized chain. Children's safety cannot be compromised. I am very worried.,2,67
"The benches in the park are made of wood and iron. The wooden planks are all broken. We cannot sit on them. The iron frame is also rusted.

Please install at least 10 new benches in the park.",2,69
"The water cooler in the bus station is giving electric shock. When someone touches the tap, they get a small shock. There is some earthing problem in the machine. This is very dangerous. It can cause a fatal accident. The power supply to the cooler should be disconnected immediately. And a qualified electrician should check and repair it. We have put a warning paper on it.",2,66
"The roof of the bus stop is made of plastic sheet. It is broken and has many holes. When it rains, all the water comes inside. It does not give any protection from rain or sun. It is useless. The transport department should replace this cheap plastic roof with a proper metal or concrete roof. The bus stop is used by many school children. They are suffering in the rain.",2,70
The community center building is in very bad condition. The plaster from the ceiling is falling down. The wiring is very old and unsafe. The toilets are leaking. It is not safe to organize any function here. This building needs major renovation work. The municipality should allocate budget for its repair. It is a very useful public asset for our community functions.,2,62
"The public sports ground has no light. After 6 PM, it is full dark. We cannot play any game. Many young people in our area want to play cricket or football after their work. If there are 4 high mast floodlights, we can use the ground till 10 PM. This will promote sports and keep the youth healthy. We are ready to contribute some money also. Please consider our request.",2,70
"The public library fans are not working. In this hot weather, it is very difficult to sit and study. Many students are preparing for exams. They need a comfortable environment. The regulator of the fans are also broken. Please send an electrician to repair all the fans. It is a small request but it will help hundreds of students. We need this on urgent basis.",2,65
The jogging track in the park is made of concrete. It is very hard on the knees. Many doctors advise against running on hard surface. It can cause joint problems. A synthetic rubber track or a clay track is much better for jogging. We request the park authority to consider changing the surface of the track. This will be very beneficial for the health of all the joggers.,2,68
The public swimming pool water is very dirty. It is not being cleaned regularly. The chlorine level is not maintained. We can see green algae on the sides. It is very unhygienic and can cause skin infections. The filtration plant is also not working properly. The manager is not taking any action. The sports department should do a surprise check and ensure the water quality is good.,2,67
"The boundary wall of the park is very low. People are jumping over it in the night for doing illegal activities. It is not safe for families. The height of the wall should be increased to at least 8 feet. Also, barbed wire should be put on top of it. This will prevent unauthorized entry and make the park more secure for everyone. We need a safe space for our children to play.",2,73
The musical fountain in the city garden is out of order since 2 years. The nozzles are choked. The lights are not working. It was a very beautiful attraction of our city. Now it is just a dirty pond. The tourism department should repair it. It will increase the beauty of the garden and attract more visitors. The equipment needs maintenance. Please revive this beautiful feature.,2,66
The 'Women Only' toilet is always locked. I have never seen it open. What is the point of making it if it is not for public use? Women are facing lot of problems in the market area. The key is with some officer who is never available. The municipality should appoint a full-time female attendant and keep it open from morning to evening. This is a very important facility for women.,2,71
The wheelchair ramp at the government hospital is a joke. The slope is more than 45 degrees. No one can push a wheelchair on it. It is not as per the standard design for disabled people. There are no handrails also. This shows how much they care for handicapped persons. The ramp should be demolished and a new one should be constructed with a gentle slope and proper railings.,2,69
The municipal gym has very old equipment. The treadmill belt is torn. The weight lifting rods are bent. It is not safe to use them. We are paying monthly fee for this gym. We expect good and safe machines. The sports officer should visit the gym and see the condition. Please approve the purchase of new modern equipment for our gym. Many youngsters are using this facility.,2,67
"The name plates of the trees in the botanical garden are missing. We cannot identify the trees. It is supposed to be an educational garden for students. But without information, it is just a normal park. The garden authority should install new name plates with the common name, scientific name and family of the tree. This will make the visit more informative and interesting for everyone.",2,66
The street vendor zone has no facility for garbage disposal. All the vendors are throwing their waste on the road. The whole area has become very dirty and unhygienic. The municipality should provide large garbage bins in the vending zone. They should also make it compulsory for the vendors to keep the area clean. A daily cleaning service is also needed for this market.,2,64
The public Wi-Fi at the metro station is not working. It shows connected but there is no internet. The speed is zero. It is just for show. The government has spent lot of money on this project but it is useless. The IT department should check the system and make it functional. A working free Wi-Fi can be very helpful for many passengers. Please get it repaired. It has never worked.,2,71
The basketball court poles are rusted and the board is broken. The ring is also bent. We cannot play basketball here. The youth of our area are very interested in this sport. We have written many applications to the sports council but there is no response. We request you to please install new fiberglass boards and rings. We will maintain it ourselves. We just need the facility.,2,67
"The designated parking lot is just a mud field. When it rains, it is full of slush. Our cars and bikes get very dirty. The municipality is charging parking fee but not giving any facility. They should at least put gravel or paver blocks to make a proper surface. There is no light also. It is not safe to park vehicles in night. Please develop this parking area properly.",2,69
The community garden tap has been disconnected. All the plants are dying without water. We residents have put lot of effort to make this garden. The municipality is supposed to provide free water for it. But they have cut the connection for some reason. We request you to please restore the water supply to our garden. We want to save our plants. It is the only green patch in our concrete colony.,2,72
"Our area transformer, which is 100 kVA pole mounted type, is making very loud humming and cracking sound. Heavy oil leakage is there from the bushings. We are very scared it will blast. The load has increased very much in our area. This transformer is very old. It needs to be replaced with a new one of higher capacity, maybe 200 kVA. Please treat this as an emergency. It is a big safety risk for all of us.",3,78
Frequent tripping of power supply is happening. Especially in evening time. The MCB at the substation is tripping again and again. It seems the feeder pillar is overloaded. The electricity department knows about this problem but they are not upgrading the system. We are paying bill on time. We need continuous power. Our children's study is getting affected. Please solve this overload issue.,3,63
"The electricity wire passing over our roof is loose and sagging. It is an uninsulated aluminum conductor. The clearance is very less. A person can get electric shock. During windy weather, it touches our TV antenna and causes sparks. This is against the IE rules. The linesman should come and pull the wire tight. Also, it is better to replace it with aerial bunched cable for safety.",3,67
"The concrete electric pole is having a big crack from top to bottom. The steel reinforcement rods are exposed and rusted. The pole has become very weak. It can fall any time. It is supporting many heavy cables. We request the electricity board to inspect this pole and if it is found unsafe, please replace it with a new spun pole. We have taken photographs of the crack.",3,68
"We are getting very low voltage, around 160-170 volts only. Our fans are running slow like helicopters. We cannot run our AC or water motor. The tube lights are flickering. This is happening for last one month. The problem is in the whole phase. The department should check the transformer tap setting or the conductor size of the main line. We are unable to use our appliances properly.",3,68
"Streetlights are switched on in full day time. From morning 9 AM to evening 5 PM, the lights are on. This is complete wastage of national resource. The timer switch or the light sensor in the control panel is faulty. It needs to be repaired or replaced. The lineman of our area is not taking any action. Please look into this matter and stop this wastage of electricity.",3,68
My electricity meter is running very fast. The reading is double than last month. But our usage is same. I think the meter is defective. The magnetic coil or the digital display might have some problem. I want to get the meter tested in the lab. Please change my meter with a new calibrated electronic meter. I cannot pay this high bill for a faulty meter. My complaint number is 4521.,3,71
"The mess of cable TV and internet wires on the electricity poles is a big problem. It is a fire hazard. The wires are non-standard and are tied in a very bad way. If one wire catches fire, it will burn the main power line also. The electricity company should not allow this. There should be a separate pole or underground duct for these communication cables. It is very unsafe and ugly.",3,72
"The tree branches are touching the 11kV high tension line. In rainy season, the wet branches can conduct electricity and cause a short circuit. It is very dangerous. The electricity department should do proper tree trimming before the monsoon starts. They should use insulated tools for this work. They should also coordinate with forest department. This is very urgent for safety.",3,61
A live wire has broken and fallen on the ground. It is sparking. The area is wet due to rain. The situation is very dangerous. Someone can get electrocuted. We have tried calling the emergency number 1912 but it is not connecting. We need immediate help. Please send your breakdown team to disconnect the power supply of this line and repair the broken wire. The location is near the water tank.,3,71
"The power cut is happening without any information. We are not getting any SMS alert. If we know the schedule, we can plan our work. But sudden power cut for 4-5 hours is very difficult to manage. Especially for shops and offices. The electricity company should have a proper system to inform the consumers about planned shutdowns. This will be a great help for us.",3,65
The transformer fencing is broken. Children are playing near the transformer. They can go inside and touch something. It is very high risk area. The earthing wire is also cut. The whole structure can be live. The company must repair the chain-link fence and put a proper 'Danger' sign board. The safety rules are not being followed here. Please take immediate action to secure the transformer area.,3,67
The bill amount is showing Rs. 50000. This is impossible for a small house. There is some error in the billing software. Maybe they have put wrong meter reading. We have gone to the office many times but they are not listening. They are telling to pay first. This is harassment. Please rectify our bill. Our average bill is only Rs. 800 per month. There is a big mistake in your system.,3,72
"The main LT feeder cable from the pole to our apartment building is very old. The insulation is cracked and peeling off. We can see the aluminum conductor inside. In rain, water can go inside and cause short circuit. The entire building's power supply depends on this cable. It should be replaced with a new armored XLPE cable of proper size. This is a very critical safety requirement.",3,68
"When the lineman comes to fix a fault, he demands money. He says if we don't pay, he will not do the work. This is corruption. The electricity service is our right. We are paying the bill. The company should take strict action against such employees. We are ready to give a written complaint. This is happening in our area all the time. The management should control this bribery.",3,69
"The neutral wire in our phase is loose. This is causing high voltage in some houses and low voltage in others. Many of our appliances like TV, fridge have been damaged. This is called neutral failure. It is a very serious technical fault. The linesman just tightens it temporarily but the problem comes back. A permanent jointing or new wire is needed. Please fix this problem permanently.",3,67
"The electricity meter box is open and the cover is broken. The meter is exposed to rain and dust. It can get damaged. Also, anyone can tamper with the meter. The electricity board should provide a new sealed meter box with a transparent cover. This is their responsibility to protect their equipment. Please arrange to replace the damaged meter box at my premises. It is not safe.",3,67
We applied for a new connection 2 months back. We have paid all the fees. But still the connection is not given. The officials are giving excuses. They are asking us to come again and again. The process is very slow and not transparent. We need the electricity connection to start our new shop. We are losing business. Please expedite our application and provide the connection.,3,66
The voltage fluctuation is very high. The lights go dim and then suddenly bright. The voltage is going up and down from 150V to 260V. Our stabilizer is cutting off all the time. This kind of power is useless and harmful for our equipments. The automatic voltage regulator (AVR) at the substation may be faulty. The engineers should check it and ensure stable voltage supply.,3,65
The electricity department is cutting our power even though we have paid the bill. There is some mistake in their record. Our payment is not updated in their system. We have the receipt of payment. But they are not listening. This is mental torture for us. The company should improve its billing and payment software. They should not disconnect power for their own mistake. It is very unprofessional.,3,68
A public plot in Radhanpur has become a dumping ground for bricks tiles and household rubbish and when neighbors burn the heaps smoke affects several streets. The plot is visible from the main road and lowers area property values. Clearing the plot fencing it and creating an authorized bulky waste drop point with scheduled removal would prevent further misuse and restore the plot for community use.,1,66
Adajan garden is a morning hub for joggers but the jogging track is cracked and puddles remain after light rain. Benches are faded and garbage tends to pile near vendor spots. The children’s playground surfacing needs replacement to prevent injuries. Regular sweeping and track resurfacing replacement of worn playground surfaces and enforcement of vendor zones would restore the garden as a healthy place for exercise families and community programs.,2,69
Adajan residents deal with nightly micro cuts that reset routers and air conditioners. Children lose online tuition sessions and elders wake suddenly as power cycles. Streetlights on the riverside walkway also flicker unreliably. We request solid phase balancing at the substation quick repair of the lighting control box and a transparent notification system for any planned work.,3,57
After the evening market in Navsari waste is left in front of shops and small alleys which makes footpaths unusable and invites rodents. The municipal schedule does not align with market close times so traders have no choice but to stack waste overnight. Running an evening sweep on market days temporary compactor bins and educating traders on separation could keep the market lanes clean and attract more customers.,1,68
Agricultural feeders near Tharad are extremely erratic. Pumps start well after midnight or not at all and diesel generators take over at heavy cost. Daytime repairs are promised but teams reach only after dark. With unpredictable irrigation schedules entire sowing plans slip. Please stabilize the ag supply window replace burnt insulators and deploy a mobile team that answers calls on the first ring.,3,63
Ahwa market goes completely dark several nights in a row. Tourists return early to hotels and vendors shut snack stalls before dinner time. ATMs display out of service messages after every cut. The complaint center promises restoration within an hour but it stretches late into night. We need quicker fault isolation crew on standby and proper lighting on the main square.,3,61
Ahwa public garden is centrally located but maintenance is irregular leaving weeds overgrown and flower beds neglected. Benches are heavily weathered and many lights do not function after sunset making evening visits uncomfortable. The children play area has loose fixtures and the walking path is uneven and slippery after rain. Regular horticulture care playground safety checks and reliable lighting would restore the park for families and seniors.,2,67
Ahwa town’s main connector to the forest area shows steep crossfall inconsistencies that pool water on one wheel path and wash the shoulder. Motorists lose control when the water hides the uneven profile. Installing longitudinal drainage restoring uniform camber and adding visible warning boards near steep gradients would reduce hydroplaning risk and help both local traffic and tourist vehicles navigating the hill approaches.,0,63
Alkapuri faces unstable evening supply that shuts shops early. Traffic signals and streetlights blank out together creating dangerous crossings. Hostels nearby heat up quickly and students gather outside in darkness. Kindly strengthen the urban feeder provide UPS to signals ensure streetlighting remains live during maintenance and issue timely SMS alerts so people can plan travel and study.,3,57
Along Barvala Road weekends see builders and householders dropping debris and old furniture into empty plots. The municipal crew picks up on Monday but in the meantime the debris becomes a visual and mosquito problem. Some heaps have sharp metal left visible creating hazards for children. A short term solution would be designated bulky waste pick up dates and a local hotline that residents can call when someone dumps illegally so enforcement acts quickly.,1,74
Along Kalavad Road scattered heaps of household and renovation waste have appeared and they grow each week because removal is inconsistent. Locals report that the piles attract stray animals and sometimes combust when people burn the rubbish. Municipal removal followed by fencing and a complaint driven rapid response team would prevent further dumping and reduce the health risk to nearby residents.,1,61
Along Narol Industrial Road employees and nearby residents have noticed industrial rejects and mixed waste dumped on the roadside at night. The black runoff stains the roadside and has a chemical odor that worries locals about groundwater contamination. Small trees and shrubs planted to form a buffer are smothered under debris. Companies nearby claim they are not responsible and municipal crews say the site is outside regular routes. Please enforce industrial waste rules arrange collection from factories and stop informal dumping on green patches.,1,84
Along Rajula coastal road fish processing leftovers and plastic packaging have been stacked near the drainage causing frequent leaks into roadside gullies. The smell attracts flies and spreads to neighboring homes on windy days. Locals worry about water pollution because runoff reaches small streams. The community would appreciate a designated fish waste collection point improved cold chain arrangements and stricter enforcement to stop ad hoc dumping on the roadside.,1,69
Along Surat ring road in the industrial stretch wrappers pallets and discarded packing are frequently dumped by contractors who do not want to pay for disposal. The heaps blow into adjacent residential areas creating dust and visual pollution. A practical solution is an onsite compaction service or frequent municipal pickups of industrial packaging with clear enforcement to stop illegal dumping in public land.,1,63
Along Tilakwada village road some households place trash on the median and children later scatter it while playing. The pile gets trampled into the roadside and rain spreads filth further. A localized solution of designated household collection bins strict pickup timing and mild penalties for placing waste outside pickup times would significantly reduce roadside litter and the health risks posed to children.,1,62
Along Zadeshwar Road the small green strip between carriageway and shops is constantly used for dumping packaging and food waste. The litter is particularly bad on market afternoons and then local children have to run through clumps of plastic to reach school. Shopkeepers say there is no convenient bin near the stalls. Introducing more bins visible signage and timely collection in the evenings would cut the waste spillage and make the street cleaner for shoppers and residents.,1,77
Along a backroad in Surendranagar some households dispose of waste in a low lying patch creating a mini landfill that attracts scavengers and blocks a small drainage line. The patch is visible from many homes and is a constant source of complaints. Clearing the patch and installing a scheduled collection point with a sign that lists pickup days would prevent the spot from becoming a landfill again.,1,67
Along the Dabhoi highway verge truckers and local residents leave disposables and bulky items creating several small mounds visible from the road. The debris also blocks the verge making it hard to pull over in emergencies. A highway sweep by the civic authority a reinforced fence and occasional signage about fines for dumping would maintain the roadside and keep the verge usable for breakdowns or emergency stops.,1,67
Along the Gandhidham port link small piles of industrial wrapping and routine packaging waste are left in empty lots making the approach unsightly and risking litter drift onto rail lines. Workers say formal disposal options are expensive and informal tipping continues. Providing a low cost industrial waste collection option and active enforcement of dumping rules during off hours would help keep transport corridors clean and functional.,1,66
Along the Okha approach road random dumping of household rubbish and broken furniture has created a chain of small mounds visible from the highway.

Gotri road sees deep rutting in the carriageway from concentrated truck movements into the industrial estates causing a bumpy unsafe ride for smaller vehicles. Batching of truck access without lane reinforcement accelerates distress. Introducing truck scheduling constructing reinforced truck lanes and providing frequent monitoring of wear hotspots would restore a smoother journey for mixed traffic and reduce vehicle wear costs on Gotri’s busy access corridor.,0,65
Halol industrial loop has several sections with crumbling shoulders and large potholes created by heavy trucks accelerating and braking. The broken shoulders cause detours into active traffic lanes and create side swipe risks. Reinforcing shoulders with structural material installing rumble strips near junctions and enforcing controlled truck speeds during peak hours would reduce aggressive loading on the pavement and lower accident exposure for all road users.,0,66
Halvad community ground hosts events but lacks permanent seating and the existing field drainage is poor so events get canceled after rain. There are no changing facilities or toilets nearby which deters organized sports. Installing modest permanent seating covered changing rooms and improving drainage would enable regular sports programs and community events without cancellations and support local youth activities safely.,2,60
Halvad rural connectors lack marked lanes and many sections have had shoulder washouts leaving drop offs at junctions. At night these are invisible and cause dangerous encounters for returning villagers. Installing reflective markers immediate temp fill of washed sections and a program to reconstruct washed stretches with geotextile stabilization would prevent recurring washouts and allow safe night travel for essential services.,0,61
Hamlets near Ghogha lose power for ten to twelve hours whenever wind picks up along the coast. Families keep kerosene lamps ready yet smoke irritates eyes and children cough at night. Fisherfolk complain that ice makers do not recover after long cuts. Please secure the coastal line with stronger poles clear creepers near the route and keep a generator backed help center open.,3,63
Harij town suffers from unreliable electricity that kills study time and shop hours. After each cut voltage returns weak and motors refuse to start. Residents have replaced chargers multiple times. We request thorough feeder testing neutral corrections where required and a weekly schedule posted at the ward office so everyone can plan errands and water filling.,3,56
Himatnagar blocks face frequent outages that leave families sweating through hot nights. Children miss early school because they slept late after restoration. The complaint desk records cases but tracking numbers do not update. Please add manpower at the substation create a public display board of ongoing faults and ensure steady night voltage so water pumps finish their schedule by dawn.,3,60
Himatnagar bus stand is heavily used but seating is sparse and the sheltered area gets wet during monsoon. Toilet facilities are substandard and the floors are slippery which creates safety risks. The public address system is hard to hear and there is no clear bay marking causing boarding confusion. Improving shelter roofing resurfacing floors improving announcements and ensuring regular sanitation would make travel simpler and safer for everyone.,2,68
Himmatnagar bypass has rough joints and poor night reflectivity which increases the risk of wrong lane usage after dark. Renewing reflective markers smoothing transitions at joints and improving night time lighting would significantly reduce wrong way and sudden lane shift occurrences.,0,41
Himmatnagar market streets are narrow but used by large buses and heavy goods vehicles leading to constant edge crushing and kerb damage. This squeezes carriageway width and creates unsafe passing conditions. Restricting large vehicles from core market hours strengthening kerbs at known failure points and improving delivery schedules with vendors would protect the pavement and ease congestion for shoppers and public transport users.,0,63
Hospitals in Mangrol rely on backups far too often because mains flicker several times a day. Nebulizers and monitors beep and reset. In homes nearby fridge lights dim and brighten constantly. The feeder passes close to salty air near the shore and gear corrodes. Kindly replace rusted hardware seal joints add surge protection and align planned outages with hospital schedules.,3,60
Idar hill approaches have missing guardrails and steep run off slopes where heavy rains wash the shoulder away exposing dangerous drop offs. Several villagers have described lucky escapes from near falls. Installing continuous guardrails repairing the slopes with erosion control and adding reflective chevrons would make the winding approaches safer for local drivers and visiting traffic during monsoon seasons.,0,59
Idar hill park offers panoramic views but steps are uneven and the handrails are loose which worries senior visitors. Benches in shaded areas are damaged and lighting is weak making dusk visits hazardous. Trail signage is minimal which confuses occasional visitors. Repairing handrails resurfacing steps upgrading benches and adding clear trail signs would make the hill park accessible safe and enjoyable all year round.,2,64
Idar market lane sees piles of packaging paper and vegetable rotting beside shop shutters during festivals and municipal collections fail to match the increased volume. Residents would welcome temporary additional pickups during festival weeks dedicated bins for wet waste and an awareness campaign asking visitors to use provided receptacles to keep market lanes clean.,1,54
Idar taluka villages go dark for hours and calls rarely connect during storms. Elders sit outside to catch a breeze because fans crawl. Farmers cannot time irrigation and cattle sheds stay unlit. Kindly strengthen the rural feeder add reclosers to cut restoration time and announce a daily two hour assured evening supply slot for households.,3,55
In Ankleshwar industrial belt sudden supply dips trip chemical reactors and drive motors. Restarting safely takes hours and product batches get wasted. Emergency lights inside units are weak because batteries never recharge fully. Nearby residential colonies also complain that elevators stop frequently. We need clear root cause analysis quick restoration during process hours and a dedicated hotline for industrial consumers during critical operations.,3,63
In Dhrangadhra an unused industrial plot receives packaging and scrap dumped by nearby units leading to environmental concerns and visual blight. Owners claim there are no convenient disposal options. A shared industrial disposal site with scheduled pick ups a small fee and enforcement against illegal dumping could stop the dumping habit and keep industrial zones tidy and safe.,1,58
In Infocity the service backlane sees nightly dumping of food packaging and broken office furniture by unscrupulous contractors who avoid disposal fees. The waste sits until the morning when building cleaners begin their shift but the continuous pattern overwhelms them. Corporate offices could partner with the civic agency to arrange scheduled bulky waste pickups enforce disposal rules in tenancy agreements and reduce the practice of midnight dumping which spoils the clean business district image.,1,74
In Jasdan refrigerators and mixers keep failing due to wild voltage swings. Local electricians say the neutral connection is weak on one stretch. Streetlights on the inner ring skip entire nights which makes roads lonely. We request immediate neutral correction replacement of corroded connectors routine night time patrols and a citizen WhatsApp alert for planned maintenance events.,3,57
In Jetpur some industrial units dump packaging and scrap into empty lots at night avoiding disposal fees. The piles are then spread by scavenging animals and create an eyesore for neighboring homes. A monitored industrial yard where factories can deposit cardboard drums and scrap at low cost plus clear penalties for illegal dumping would stop the midnight tip-offs and keep industrial neighborhoods orderly.,1,63
In Kalol bazaar vendors pile discardable packaging and organic matter near shop exits which is then scattered by scavengers and rodents overnight. The piles make early morning pedestrian routes unpleasant and can be avoided if the municipal pick up aligns with market closure. An evening collection scheme designated vendor bins and enforcement against leaving waste in lanes would keep the bazaar clean and safe.,1,64
In Khambhat near the salt yard builders and householders dump mixed waste in open gullies which damages the fragile roadside vegetation and clogs small culverts. During high tides some of this waste drifts into low lying fields and residents fear contamination of shallow wells. The municipal schedule seems infrequent and waste piles remain for weeks. A targeted cleanup drive proper bulk waste collection points and public messaging about not dumping near salt pans would be helpful.,1,76
In Maninagar the arterial road near the market is riddled with potholes and uneven patches which worsen every monsoon. Rickshaw drivers swerve into opposing lanes to bypass damaged areas and pedestrians are forced to step into traffic. The street lighting is dim at many stretches making these holes invisible at night and causing frequent falls. Small businesses complain of reduced footfall as shoppers avoid the jolt filled walk. Please plan a proper overlay widen shoulders where possible and mark temporary hazards until permanent fix is completed.,0,86
In Nadiad temple lane pilgrims and visitors often discard ceremonial flowers and wrappers which build up quickly during holiday periods overwhelming the small municipal bins. The resulting wet piles block drain gullies and cause muddy lanes. Temple committees and local authorities could coordinate temporary overflow bins and volunteer cleanup shifts during festivals to avoid repeated accumulation and protect the sanctity of the area.,1,63
In Rajpipla market corner plastic sacks and wet waste often pile up after traders close and the municipal sweeper arrives late. The resulting smell and flies spill into neighboring homes and shops making early morning trade unpleasant. A practical solution involves an after market clean up run extra bins for wet compostable waste and targeted vendor training to prevent piles left overnight.,1,62
In Ranavav market drivers and small traders dump sacks and wet waste into a roadside hollow creating a persistent heap that attracts dogs and birds. The municipal run picks up main roads but smaller alleys are neglected. Creating a simple micro collection point and informing traders of exact evening pick up times would discourage ad hoc dumping and keep small lanes clear for pedestrians.,1,64
In Sankheda power flickers all evening. LED bulbs blink rapidly and television set top boxes reboot in loops. Streetlights along the school road are out and parents escort kids with phone torches. The lineman says trees touch the line during breeze. Please deploy a pruning drive replace cracked insulators and stabilize voltage so children can study comfortably after sunset.,3,59
In Tharad several stretches beside the roadside drain have accumulated construction scraps and household refuse. When rains arrive the drain chokes and water overflows into homes lowering hygiene standards and increasing insect problems. Locals are frustrated that the same patches are cleared only to be reused. Fixing this requires a permanent barrier a public bin network and enforcement so people cannot keep dumping in drain lines and endangering neighbors.,1,69
In Vidyanagar student hostels experience frequent low voltage that turns laptops off mid assignment. Wi Fi routers reset repeatedly and online classes disconnect. The campus pathways become patchy dark because alternate light poles do not switch on. Many PG kitchens rely on induction cooktops which simply refuse to start. Please check earthing improve phase balancing and restore full brightness to the academic area streetlighting.,3,64
In Waghai town center weekend markets generate a lot of organic and plastic waste and there are simply not enough bins or collection points. Traders throw leftovers into empty plots and locals complain about increased pests. A market day protocol with assigned waste volunteers and a dedicated market day collection run by municipal trucks would stop the conversion of open plots into garbage heaps and keep the town center tidy.,1,70
In Zanzarda market lane traders pile organic waste and plastic into small alleys and children walk through muddy littered paths to get to school. During rains the stench is particularly bad and the municipal schedules seem mismatched to the market peak. Introducing a market day waste collection window immediate evening removal and vendor training on waste handling would greatly reduce daily spillover and improve local hygiene.,1,66
In front of Valsad station leftover food waste plastic and cardboard pile up after busy arrival times and cleaners cannot keep pace especially during festivals. The litter spills onto the footpath making pedestrian access messy and attracting stray animals. Adding more bins near exits optimizing the cleanup schedule for peak arrival times and deploying volunteers during festivals would make the station approach cleaner and more welcoming.,1,66
In the Takhteshwar neighborhood residents have noticed bags of household waste left near a storm inlet which quickly overflows during monsoon. The municipality picks up main roads but inner lanes are skipped so people resort to dumping in the nearest visible spot. Blocked drains then cause street flooding and rotten smells near homes. Creating a door to door schedule or localized mini collection points could stop these unsafe dumping habits and restore hygiene.,1,73
Industrial units in Kadi stop production when mains fail without notice. Dyeing machines cool mid cycle ruining fabric. Commuters leaving late find the outer ring unlit because feeder linked streetlights also trip. Diesel backups raise costs for everyone. Kindly create a protected industrial corridor supply install automatic reclosers and assign an on call engineer to coordinate rapid restorations.,3,58
Industries in Lodhika report unstable supply that stops production and wastes material mid process. Workers sit idle waiting for restoration and late shifts stretch into night. Nearby housing colonies also face flickering lights. Please provide a dedicated industrial feeder with redundancy coordinate planned shutdowns better and keep public streetlighting active even when maintenance is underway.,3,55
Infocity bus bays serve office goers but during peak office hours the shelters overflow and there are too few seating options. The digital displays are often blank and passengers stand on the roadside which is dangerous during busy traffic. Drinking water outlets dry up in the afternoon and the whole area lacks tidy waste bins. Enlarging the waiting bays installing functional displays and ensuring water availability would ease daily commutes.,2,70
Infocity ring road construction left many temporary trenches poorly reinstated and the resulting surface is a mosaic of patched areas that break up under repeated traffic. During peak office hours lane shifting and sudden braking increase crash risk and slow commutes. Ensuring all utility reinstatements are completed to specification and a single final overlay to smooth the entire corridor would restore travel reliability for thousands of daily commuters.,0,68
Isanpur residents are fed up with the narrow residential lanes that have yet to be resurfaced after last winter. The substandard repairs left ridges and poor drainage that floods doorsteps during moderate rains. Many elders struggle to walk on the uneven paths and two wheeler riders report regular punctures from exposed debris. Local committees have written several times but the work stalls. A phased resurfacing program with priority for drainage correction lighting and safe pedestrian walkways would significantly improve everyday mobility here.,0,82
Jafrabad’s port approach road is pitted and salt affected causing frequent tyre and suspension damage for small fish transporters. Speed reduction signage is absent and unsealed edges crumble under moisture. A targeted reconstruction with salt tolerant material proper edge protection and improved signage for vehicle speeds would protect both fragile local vehicles and the economic fish distribution chain.,0,58
Jalalpore approach road has sharp transitions at utility trenches that were poorly reinstated leading to big bumps and joint depressions. Local drivers try to avoid these at night and swerve unexpectedly. A coordinated utility completion inspection program followed by a single smooth overlay and a patrol to monitor early failure would prevent sudden dangerous maneuvers and restore predictable lane behaviour for the corridor.,0,63
Jalalpore garden is valued by families but the footpaths have sunk and create puddles after a shower. Benches are damaged and the toddlers play area has exposed edges. Lighting fails on several poles leaving isolated dark pockets in the evening. Repairing walkway levels replacing worn benches and restoring lighting would encourage safe evening use and keep families returning for recreation.,2,60
Jam Jodhpur taluka has faced ten plus hour blackouts after each storm this month. Farmers say irrigation cycles are ruined and seedlings show stress. Mobile towers go off air and families cannot reach support lines. Please stock spare poles locally run quick patrols to locate faults and update restoration progress through panchayat loudspeakers until networks resume.,3,56
Jambusar railway halt is basic but commuters need cleaner platforms and more seating. The shelter is too small and during rains passengers wait in muddy patches. The single drinking water tap sometimes runs dry and the platform lights are dim. Clear maps and a small assistance desk would help elderly passengers and those carrying luggage board safely and travel comfortably on local trains.,2,63
Jamnagar bypass displays patch sentiment with wide cracks forming along the wheel paths indicating base fatigue. For a long haul route handling truck convoys a structural full depth repair or overlay that builds thickness and improves load distribution would be the correct long term remedy rather than continued surface patches which fail quickly under heavy repeated loading.,0,57
Jamnagar city garden attracts families on weekends but the lawn is patchy and irrigation is inconsistent. Children’s equipment is dated and safety surfacing is missing in high fall zones. Litter collects near vendor spots and the caretaking staff is thin so garbage lingers through the day. A focused replanting initiative regular irrigation schedule and updating playground surfacing would bring the garden back to a welcoming condition for families.,2,68
Jetpur Pavi taluka struggles with hours long outages that push school studies to daylight. Small tailors cannot run sewing machines reliably. The feeder crosses wooded stretches where branches often fall. Kindly intensify tree trimming before monsoon install insulated conductors on risky spans and provide a clear weekly schedule so villagers can plan irrigation and homework routines.,3,56
Jetpur busier connectors show alligator cracking and patch failure particularly near the textile hubs where short heavy convoys repeat loads on the same wheel paths. Local repair cycles do not address binder depletion and patch repairs fail quickly. A broad rejuvenation treatment re strengthening of the base and a temporary traffic diversion during full depth repair would restore a stable surface that sustains industrial movement.,0,65
Jetpur railway halt is small and often crowded without enough covered seating. Platform surfacing is uneven and boarding is unsafe for elderly travelers or those with luggage. The lone water tap is frequently out of order and night lighting is insufficient. A modest platform resurfacing addition of a covered waiting area and regular water supply would significantly improve the comfort and safety of daily commuters using this halt.,2,68
Jhalod rural areas go without power for long stretches daily. Families rely on lanterns and children fear walking along dark roads. Farmers cannot lift water in the evening and shift to costly diesel. Please build resilience with sectionalizers along the long feeder prune trees before storms and guarantee a predictable evening supply so households regain routine.,3,56
Jubilee garden in Rajkot is popular but the lawns have bare patches and irrigation seems inconsistent. The paved jogging track shows wear and the children’s area surfacing is indoors missing hope. Benches are not clean and the decorative lighting is unreliable at night discouraging families. Ensuring a consistent watering regime repairing the track and upgrading playground surfacing along with reliable night lighting would make the garden vibrant again.,2,68
Junagadh bypass has cross fall inconsistencies and several utility manholes sitting proud of surface leading to jolts and vehicular damage. Repairing and resetting all service covers to flush grade followed by a continuous overlay will remove sudden bumps and bring the driving surface up to acceptable safety standards for through traffic.,0,51
Junagadh central park has been neglected with cracked walkways and overgrown hedges blocking visibility. The children play area has loose screws and the rubber surfacing is degraded. Lighting is erratic after sundown and security presence is missing which makes visitors wary. A restoration program to resurface tracks repair playground fixtures and restore reliable lighting would encourage families to use the park again especially for evening recreation.,2,66
Kadana viewpoint park offers good river views but seating is scarce and guardrails near edges need strengthening. Steps leading down to the viewpoint are uneven and slippery when wet. Lighting at dusk is poor and litter gathers after weekend crowds. Repairing guardrails resurfacing steps adding shaded seating and introducing a weekly cleanup would make the viewpoint safer and more welcoming for families and tourists.,2,64
Kadi industrial frontage has recurring transverse cracking near heavy loading areas and the pavement distresses quickly after each repair. The repeated interruptions affect freight schedules and raise transport costs. Investing in a higher structural pavement section for the loading lanes and scheduled maintenance slots during off peak hours would maintain freight reliability and minimize disruption to industry operations.,0,58
Kadi town park has a popular morning crowd but paths are uneven and park lighting is unreliable at dusk. Many children play on hard surfaces without safety mats and the swings creak loudly. There is no kiosk for first aid water or shelter in sudden weather events. Installing soft fall surfaces for play areas repairing pathway levels and improving lighting would encourage more regular safe use by families.,2,68
Kalabhavan circle stop serves many routes but the covered section offers little shade and seating is scarce. Timetable display boards are faded and announcements do not reach the entire shelter forcing passengers to stand in heat. Drainage near the stop is poor so runoff pools during monsoon. An upgraded shelter with vented roofing better seating and improved drainage would significantly improve daily commuter comfort and safety.,2,66
Kalol industries repeatedly report production delays because feeder trips occur without notice. Workers are sent home early and orders slip. Residential areas see the same dips and elevators stall. We request a protected industrial corridor supply better coordination of planned shutdowns and immediate communication via SMS and web so both factories and families can schedule around maintenance.,3,57
Kalol sports field is used by local youth but the surface is uneven and has stones causing frequent minor injuries. There are no changing rooms or dedicated toilets for players and floodlights are non functional which prevents evening practice. Parents avoid sending teams for training due to the poor facilities. Leveling the field adding basic sanitary facilities and repairing floodlights would enable safer regular sporting activities.,2,66
Kalol urban roads have multiple utility access covers sitting at different heights from the surrounding pavement which creates jarring level changes for two wheelers. Multiple complaints show repeated repairs without alignment. Coordinating a program to flush cover levels to the final surfacing grade followed by a continuous wearing course overlay would eliminate these hazardous bumps and make travel smoother and safer through the commercial zones.,0,65
Kalupur railway station struggles with cleanliness and passenger convenience. The waiting rooms are overcrowded and seating is insufficient. Toilets are often locked or unhygienic and drinking water taps malfunction intermittently. Signage is confusing for visitors especially those with luggage. People with mobility issues find the foot overbridge steep with no reliable lifts escalators. Better housekeeping more seating and accessible facilities would help thousands of travelers every day.,2,67
Kapadvanj bus stop is crowded at school start and end times but lacks sufficient benches and shelter. Rainwater seeps into the shelter corners making the floor muddy. The timetable is posted but faded and public toilets nearby are poorly maintained. Adding robust shelter seating a raised and drained floor and ensuring daily cleaning of the toilets would protect passengers and make daily commutes comfortable for children and elders alike.,2,69
Kapadvanj experiences persistent low voltage that ruins refrigerators and blenders. Electricians say one phase carries too much. Streetlights also alternate between bright and dim creating a strobe effect along the lake road. Residents feel unsafe on walks. Kindly balance phases install corrective capacitors and publish a feeder map so people know whom to contact when specific stretches go dark.,3,59
Kapadvanj’s shortcut lanes have no formal pedestrian footpath and heavy bikes use the same narrow corridor as pedestrians and cattle. The surface wears fast and night time visibility is poor due to missing lights. Formalizing a narrow footpath adding reflective bollards and fixing the most worn surface sections would protect walkers and provide safer passing space for local traffic through this traditionally compact town fabric.,0,65
Kawant rural connectors are narrow single lane roads with minimal drainage so after moderate rains the track becomes a muddy hazard. Motorists avoid these links and take longer alternate routes increasing travel time and cost. Widening shoulders adding simple cross drains and gravel stabilisation would transform these farm roads into reliable year round links and prevent school buses and ambulances from getting stuck during monsoon periods.,0,66
Kawant village square is a community hub but permanent seating is sparse and the covered shade has torn fabric. During festivals the temporary stalls get parked on the walking paths blocking access. There is no public restroom nearby and the stage sound system is outdated so events become noisy and unclear. Investing in durable covered seating a public toilet and a small sound upgrade would support community events safely.,2,69
Kevadia’s tourism zones struggle when outages disrupt hotel lighting and promenade shows. Guests complain and bookings fall. Nearby residential quarters also see unstable supply. Please provide a ring main with redundancy for the hospitality strip align maintenance with low visitor hours and restore pathway lighting quickly so evening walks near the river remain safe and inviting.,3,56
Khambhalia faces four to six hour blackouts almost daily. Shopkeepers now maintain diesel generators that are noisy and expensive. Families keep meals half cooked waiting for supply to return. The helpline logs complaints but resolution numbers are not shared. Please replace aged conductors along the main feeder publish restoration ETAs and assign a nodal officer to coordinate communication.,3,58
Khambhaliya city park used to host morning clubs but now the jogging path has large cracks and the exercise equipment shows signs of rust. Benches near the pond are broken and the water edge needs a safety rail. Lighting fails by dusk leaving stretches dark and unwelcoming. Resurfacing the path repairing equipment and restoring lights would return fitness enthusiasts and families to the park.,2,64
Khambhaliya market has piles of mixed waste outside shops which often remain for days leading to bad odors and slippery pavements. The vendors say municipal pickup schedules do not match market hours and traders cannot store wet refuse onsite. A revised collection time after market closure designated vendor bins and an awareness drive about sorting wet and dry waste would greatly reduce the leftover piles and improve hygiene.,1,68
Khambhaliya’s market access road is potholed and sometimes covered with grime from adjacent fish processing units which reduces skid resistance. Two wheelers often lose traction and local shops see reduced evening trade as shoppers avoid the rough stretch. A targeted cleaning program to remove residues regular sweeping daily coupled with asphalt repair and clearer drainage would improve safety and restore confidence for shoppers and delivery vehicles.,0,66
Khambhat coastal approach shows early signs of alligator cracking and the surface loses aggregate when truck traffic accelerates. Portable trade stalls set up at the roadside reduce clear lane width and sudden braking near the stalls is a common cause for near collisions. Public lighting is inconsistent at night and the combination of rough surface and blind spots is dangerous. Permanent resurfacing with clear vendor areas and resurfaced pedestrian crossings near high footfall points would reduce risk and revive local commerce.,0,81
Khambhat lakefront walking path is charming but many benches are damaged and the protective railing is loose near bends. Night time illumination is patchy and several light posts are out so walkers do not feel safe returning after dusk. Trash accumulates quickly during weekends and there is no regular sweep team. Fixing railings installing continuous lighting and placing robust bins at intervals would protect both families and tourists.,2,68
Kheda city streets show repeated trench reinstatement failures and poor walkway transitions creating hazards to pedestrians and cyclists. Coordinating a city wide program to standardize reinstatement practices and perform street finishing works that include accessible kerb ramps and pedestrian refuges would vastly improve urban mobility and safety across the town.,0,50
Kodinar bazaar traders often stack cardboard and packing materials in vacant lots overnight and some of these piles are set alight later creating smoke that disturbs nearby residents and schools. The ash and black soot settle on roofs and clothes. A scheduled cardboard pickup and a community awareness plan to avoid nighttime burning would eliminate the smoke and keep the market area neat and safe.,1,65
Kodinar bus stand is compact but lacks covered seating and the waiting area floods in heavy rain. Timetable details are limited and many travelers stand on the dusty shoulder while waiting. Better drainage covered seating a clear display board and periodic cleaning would make daily travel safer especially for school children and elderly residents who use this stand frequently.,2,59
Kodinar homes experience frequent voltage dips that quietly damage appliances. Fisher families complain that freezers pulse on and off at night. Streetlights along the coastal approach are unreliable which makes late rides unsafe. Kindly check neutral connections replace salt corroded fittings and stabilize night time voltage so both households and fisheries can function without constant repair bills.,3,57
Kodinar market road has intermittent potholes and broken gutters causing water to pool and silt to cover the carriageway. Steps to the roadside stalls swallow water and pedestrians step into the road to avoid the pools increasing risk of collision. Reconstructing gutters ensuring free flow to drains and resurfacing the carriageway with proper camber would prevent pooling and keep both traffic and pedestrians safer during the monsoon.,0,67
Kutiyana bus stop has very limited shelter and seating and the pavement often gets muddy when it rains. Passengers frequently stand on the roadside exposing them to passing traffic and dust. A rebuilt shelter with raised paved floor additional benches and improved drainage would protect waiting passengers and provide a more dignified experience particularly for school children and elderly residents who rely on local buses daily.,2,66
Kutiyana taluka faces frequent line trips and families remain in the dark for hours. Streetlights along the bridge are off most nights. Electricians suggest cracked insulators near the river crossing. Kindly replace those components harden the span against wind add real time fault indicators and restore regular lighting so commuters and pedestrians feel safe after dusk.,3,56
Kutiyana to nearby villages road network is stressed by over dimension agricultural trailers and thin pavement historically not designed for heavy loads. Plastering of temporary patches happens in response to complaints but the underlying base remains weak and fails again. A program for structural strengthening adding thicker layers and distributing heavy traffic to stronger roads via load controls would preserve the network and keep rural communities connected.,0,67
Lathi bus station is the town hub but the waiting hall is small and seats are scarce. Toilets are in poor condition with unreliable water supply and handwashing facilities. There is no covered area for passengers during heat or rain and the information board shows outdated schedules. Local elders are especially affected when buses are delayed. Investing in basic shelter seating and cleaned sanitary facilities would make a big difference to commuters.,2,72
Law Garden is popular among families and street shoppers but the walkways are cracked and uneven creating trip hazards. Decorative lights are broken and trash bins overflow during weekends. Vendors set up without proper stalls which crowds pathways and blocks emergency access. The children play area lacks soft flooring and fences are rusting. A management plan for vendor zones improved lighting and daily cleaning would return the space to safe family use.,2,72
Limbdi connectors have inconsistent edge treatment which results in frequent shoulder collapses and vehicle overhangs during passing maneuvers. Night time visibility is poor and reflective guideposts are missing. Installing continuous delineators elevating the shoulders and performing a pre monsoon resurfacing would protect the corridor and reduce emergency recoveries due to vehicles losing support on the shoulders.,0,56
Limbdi town park is attractive but paths are uneven making it difficult for strollers and wheelchairs. Play equipment has chipped paint and the toddler zone lacks safe flooring. Benches are few and many light posts are not functioning at night. Prioritizing path repairs installing safe surfacing for play areas and ensuring lighting at dusk would make the park accessible and comfortable for all age groups again.,2,66
Limkheda rural roads suffer from frequent edge failures and missing signboards at critical bends. During foggy mornings visibility is poor and the combination of unmarked hazards and low friction surfaces has led to avoidable crashes. Installing reflective chevrons cleaning culverts and resurfacing the worn stretches with improved skid resistant surfacing would reduce these incidents and provide safer access for school buses and emergency services.,0,64
Long stretches of the Sabarmati Riverfront go dark when the lighting feeder trips. Families on evening walks turn back early and cycling groups avoid the route. Nearby apartments also report quick voltage dips that reset elevators. Kindly repair the control cabinets replace corroded connectors along the promenade and keep at least one redundant circuit live for public safety lighting.,3,59
Low voltage in Limbdi villages prevents borewell pumps from starting even though the line is technically live. Women wait with water pots until late night. Children complete homework under torchlight. The field team blames feeder overload. We request phased load shifting addition of capacitors and a guaranteed high voltage window in the early evening for domestic water pumping.,3,58
Lunawada garden is used by students and older residents but the walking loop has pot holes and waterlogged sections after moderate rains. The children’s play area is small and lacks modern soft surfacing. Benches are weathered with peeling varnish and the garden lacks consistent sweeping so litter remains. Resurfacing the loop adding safer play surfaces and a simple daily cleaning roster would bring families back to the park without worry.,2,70
Lunawada residents endure six to seven hour outages that start at unpredictable times. Shops rely on candles and UPI payments fail due to dead routers. Children use phone flashlights to finish homework. A humming noise from the main transformer was heard before the last failure. Kindly replace the aging unit strengthen earthing add lightning arresters and share a weekly maintenance calendar.,3,61
Lunawada town streets display repeated edge failures and inadequate streetlight coverage causing nighttime hazards on twisty lanes. Several residents reported minor collisions where drivers meet on narrow stretches and have to swerve onto shoulders that have collapsed. Restoring full width through shoulder reconstruction adding low height guide rails and ensuring functional lights at all intersections would immediately improve night time safety for local travelers and school children.,0,67
Lunawada weekly market leaves behind significant amounts of wet waste and plastic which often sits until the next collection day. The accumulation leads to foul odors and insect problems for small shops. An extra evening pickup on market days a separated compostable waste collection and vendor training on proper disposal would reduce the leftover piles and make the market streets more pleasant for shoppers and residents.,1,66
Mahemdavad market backlane often becomes a repository for trader waste especially cardboard and onion skins which attract rats. Clean up happens but the same vendors return to the practice. A simple remedy would be to provide a compaction bin a clear schedule for removal and a vendor liaison to keep market waste off the lanes and protect early morning pedestrian access.,1,61
Mahemdavad riverfront park has great potential but broken tiles and a damaged safety rail near the water make it risky for families with small children. Many lamps are out leaving the promenade dim at dusk. Picnic spots have no bins and waste accumulates. Repairing the railing fixing paving and installing a few robust bins coupled with steady maintenance would encourage safe recreational use of the riverfront.,2,66
Mahemdavad town road has continuous ridging and settlement at old trench locations leading to a rough ride and poor drainage. The marketplace intensifies wear and the municipal team appears reactive rather than proactive. Coordinated trench acceptance standards a planned overlay program and a preventive maintenance calendar before the monsoon would avoid repeated distress and keep commerce flowing.,0,57
Mahuva coastal link road has a history of patch repairs but suffers from longitudinal cracking and subgrade erosion near the shoreline. Salt spray accelerates deterioration and drainage gullies fill with sand. Trucks carrying fish crates splash wet organic liquids onto the carriageway reducing skid resistance. Reconstruction with a resilient binder design salt tolerant materials and improved side drainage would lengthen the pavement life and improve safety for commercial and passenger vehicles alike.,0,72
Mahuva fish market and surrounding lanes go dark almost every day at peak hour. Ice stalls scramble to save stock and traffic around the circle becomes chaotic without lights. Families in nearby chawls struggle with heat. Kindly coordinate maintenance outside market hours strengthen connections near saline air zones and restore full brightness to the market approach roads.,3,57
Major residential lanes in Navsari remain dim because many streetlight poles stay dead for weeks. Joggers avoid early mornings and women discourage children from cycling after dusk. Meanwhile homes face micro cuts that reset Wi Fi repeatedly. Please restore full lighting replace weak contactors in control boxes and publish a simple number coded map so complaints reach the right crew quickly.,3,61
Maliya’s pottery workers lose productive hours because supply wavers during kiln firing. Batches crack and orders get delayed. In colonies around the yard fans run slow and children sweat through the night. Please plan shutdowns away from firing hours add a stabilizer bank near the industrial cluster and fix streetlighting on the approach so workers return safely.,3,57
Mandvi coastal roads suffer wave wash and salt damage with weakened binder and surface flakes that reduce grip. Motorists report skids during early morning when fines have been deposited. A corrosion resistant surfacing approach inclusion of sealed joints and periodic surface dressing to reintroduce aggregate friction would protect the pavement and maintain safe traction for vehicles that access the beachside communities and tourism spots.,0,64
Mandvi market alley is prone to leftover refuse from small shops and eateries and municipal buckets are often full by late afternoon. Traders then stack the waste beside walls attracting cattle and pests. A better solution would be more bins during peak hours an evening removal run and vendor cooperation to place waste only in designated spots rather than open alleys.,1,61
Mangrol coastal road has sharp edge raveling where salt laden winds erode the binder leaving loose surface aggregates. Heavy trucks rapidly remove fines and the road degrades into rough gravel prone to dust and stone scattering.

Shore protection measures maintenance of protective embankment and re establishment of the carriageway edge with appropriate transition help would secure the approach for both local fisher traffic and visitor coaches.,0,73
Okha port passenger area has a small waiting hall yet seating is insufficient and the area lacks clean drinking water. During ferry times crowds gather and there is little shelter from gusty winds. Baggage handling space is cramped and announcements are unclear. Expanding covered seating improving water supply and setting up a proper luggage zone with clearer public address systems would help travelers navigate the port more comfortably.,2,68
Okha’s fishing community suffers most when power fails at night. Ice plants stop and the catch begins to thaw. The next morning buyers bargain hard because quality drops. Homes nearby also struggle with weak night lighting and elderly residents stumble on stairs. Kindly provide a dedicated supply line for cold storage units and guarantee minimum evening hours for residential feeders.,3,60
On Karjan outskirts an abandoned plot accumulates mixed waste from nearby households because municipal collection is inconsistent. Locals sometimes burn the pile which spreads smoke into nearby colonies. A short term clean up followed by fencing a scheduled local pickup and community awareness would stop the illegal use of the plot and restore it for community benefit.,1,57
On Kawant outskirts a private plot has been turned into an unofficial landfill with household and construction debris dumped without restriction. The mound grows and when burned the smoke affects neighboring homes. Families request the municipality to clear the site fence it and post penalties for repeat dumping. Offering a low cost municipal bulky waste pick up may persuade builders and home renovators to use formal channels instead of polluting community land.,1,72
On Kutiyana outskirts people from nearby rural plots drop construction rubble and domestic waste into empty fields making them unusable for grazing and creating visual blight. Clearing the fields fencing and providing a low cost municipal option for bulky waste removal could stop the practice and preserve farmland and grazing grounds for local farmers.,1,54
On Limkheda village road householders and some small shops dump waste into roadside ditches because pickup is infrequent. Piles include plastics and wet food which draws flies to doors and blocks tiny culverts. Villagers suggest a weekly village collection truck designated spots and stricter fines for illegal dumping to encourage proper disposal rather than throwing refuse in public drains which then impacts everyone during rains.,1,65
On Porbandar beachside visitors often leave food wrappers and bottles that get trapped around rocks after high tide. The municipal cleaning is regular but the volume during weekends overwhelms the crew. Installing more beach bins signage encouraging carry back policies and organizing volunteer weekend beach cleans would keep the sands tidy and protect marine birds from ingesting plastics.,1,58
On the Kadi industrial corridor contractors sometimes dispose of packaging and empty drums in vacant lots rather than pay for proper disposal.

A revitalized storm water inlet design and a public schedule for clearing leaf and plastic blockage would maintain flow and protect the adjacent pavements.,0,68
Siddhpur experiences daily four to five hour cuts that start after sunset. Shops bring out candles and handheld fans whirr in cramped rooms. Families delay dinner until supply returns. Helpline promises are vague. Kindly issue a weekly schedule add another distribution transformer for the dense lane behind the hospital and deploy a mobile crew during evening peak to reduce downtime.,3,60
Sidhpur bus stand has a small passenger shelter that overwhelms with crowds during market timings. Seats are limited and the timetable board is outdated. Public toilets need deep cleaning and drinking water taps often run dry. Boarding becomes disorderly when multiple services arrive together. Expanding sheltered seating upgrading toilet maintenance and adding clearer bay numbers would reduce chaos and provide dignity to daily commuters.,2,64
Sidhpur street market produces a lot of wet waste from fresh stalls and when the municipal truck timing is too early vendors leave refuse in side alleys. These leftover piles attract pests and cause bad smells during the day. A revised pickup time keyed to actual market closure a request for traders to bag wet waste and a small composter nearby could cut the volume of waste left on streets.,1,70
Sidhpur’s main street is marred by deep potholes at drain junctions and the pedestrian walkway is narrowed by parked vehicles. During peak trade hours the carriageway becomes congested and emergency vehicles have trouble passing. Enforcing parking restrictions creating loading bays and resurfacing the worst affected pockets with full depth repairs would restore safe access and reduce delays during busy market periods.,0,61
Sihor neighborhoods report wild voltage swings that fry chargers routers and ceiling fans. Repair crews change fuses but the problem returns in two days.

We ask for line strengthening additional poles proper earthing and clear communication on feeder wise supply timings.,3,62
Villages near Subir forest still do not enjoy steady evening power. Children do homework by lantern and parents worry about smoke indoors. When supply returns voltage is too low to start mixers or pumps. We request hybrid support with solar streetlights insulated lines through dense foliage and a guaranteed two hour stable slot after sunset for households.,3,57
Visavadar access roads to remote villages show a classic case of fatigue cracking and pothole progression due to overloaded farm traffic. Minor repairs are quick to fail. Strengthening the pavement structure with a deeper reconstructed base overlay and limiting axle loads combined with seasonal maintenance before monsoon will protect these connectors so school buses and ambulances can serve reliably.,0,59
Visavadar market square needs improved seating and shade for shoppers who often stand between shops. The communal public toilet is unhygienic and water taps falter making it inconvenient for long markets. During festivals the square becomes over crowded without clear guidance and emergency access is restricted. Installing more benches repair toilets and implementing vendor flow management during busy days would make markets more welcoming and safer for shopping.,2,68
Visavadar town square often has leftover picnic waste and plastic after weekend events which get swept only after several days leaving residents to tolerate bad odor and pests. A volunteer rota for festival cleanup temporary additional collection runs for event days and more bins around the square would keep the public space usable and reduce the burden on municipal staff alone.,1,61
Visnagar market road piles of vegetable waste and plastic pile up as the market closes because municipal trucks pass earlier in the day. The stagnant heaps are a mosquito breeding ground and block footpaths. Shifting collection times to late evening during market days provision of more wet waste bins and vendor education on piling waste only at assigned locations would keep pavements clean and reduce health risks for residents.,1,69
Visnagar railway halt is small with limited seating and a narrow platform making passengering boarding awkward when two trains come close. The shelter offers little protection from rain and the drinking water tap is often out of order. A modest expansion of the covered area more seating and a consistently working water point would ease daily travel especially for elderly and school children who use this halt frequently.,2,68
Visnagar’s suburban belt roads lack continuous edge drains and the negligence creates saturated shoulders that collapse under light traffic forcing vehicles into the central lane. School buses frequently get stuck in the soft shoulders. Installing continuous shallow drains providing stable shoulders and carrying out an overlay in targeted weak spots would ensure reliable year round access for students and commuters without frequent emergency calls for vehicle recovery.,0,67
Vyara bus stand serves multiple routes but the shelter is too small for congregating passengers. The toilets are poorly maintained with irregular water supply and there is no drinking water outlet.

Waghai to nearby hamlet roads have potholes that swallow small two wheelers especially at night since street lighting is absent for long stretches. Ambulances take alternate longer routes which delays medical care. Prioritizing night lighting repairs and interim temporary surfacing on critical links until full rehabilitation can be completed would immediately reduce accident risk and improve health outcomes by speeding emergency travel.,0,62
Wankaner bus hub has limited seating and shelter so passengers stand on the roadside during busy hours. Public toilets are found but poorly maintained and water points sometimes dry up.

big tree branch fell on power line. very dangerous. its raining also. plz send team to cut it now.,3,19
"I went to the electricity office to get a correction on my bill because they charged me for the wrong meter number. I took all my documents, my ID, the incorrect bill, my payment receipts, everything. I had to wait in line for two hours just to be told that the person who handles this is on leave and to come back next week. It's their mistake, but I'm the one who has to waste my whole day running around. It's so frustrating how difficult they make it to fix their own errors.",3,93
"You are hereby notified of an unacceptable delay in providing a new electricity connection for my premises (Application #582-B). The statutory period of 30 days, as per the Electricity Act, has long expired. This delay is causing me significant financial loss. If the connection is not installed and activated within the next 7 business days, I will be filing a grievance with the Electricity Regulatory Commission and seeking compensation for the damages incurred due to your department's inefficiency.",3,78
"I had such a delightful experience calling your customer service helpline today. The hold music was truly captivating; I listened to it for a full 45 minutes. And the automated voice that kept telling me how important my call was made me feel so special. Although I never actually got to speak to a human being, the journey was what mattered, right? Thank you for that meditative, zen-like experience. My problem is still not solved, but I feel incredibly patient now.",3,81
Good morning. I'm conducting a small survey and was hoping you could help. Are the streetlights in your operational manual listed under 'nocturnal' or 'diurnal' appliances? The ones on my street seem to be running on a solar schedule – they switch off at night and blaze all day long. Is this a new policy to help reduce night-time light pollution? Or is it possible the control switch is simply stuck? I'm just trying to make sense of the strategy.,3,80
road divider is broken. big chunks of concrete on road. accident can happen. plz remove debris.,0,16
"Every single evening when I'm coming home from my office in Koramangala, I get stuck at that Silk Board junction for at least 45 minutes, and it's all because the signal timing is a complete mess and the bus lane is always blocked by autos. Yesterday I saw an ambulance struggling to get through. It's not just about being late; it's a real failure of traffic management that affects thousands of us every day. A little bit of planning and enforcement could solve so much of this headache.",0,88
"This notice is to formally hold your department responsible for the damage to my vehicle's tyres, caused by sharp construction debris left negligently on the road after recent pipe-laying work. I have photographic evidence and a mechanic's report. I expect a full reimbursement for the repair costs, amounting to Rs. 4,500. Failure to respond within 15 days will result in a formal claim being filed at the consumer court for damages and negligence.",0,73
"I must congratulate you on the recent road repair. The patch job you did on that pothole lasted a whole week! That must be a new record. Now the hole is back, bigger and angrier than before. It's wonderful. This recurring repair cycle is surely a brilliant job creation scheme. Thank you for your commitment to temporary solutions. It keeps things exciting.",0,62
"Hello, I have a question regarding the 'No Parking' sign on our street. Is it purely decorative? I'm asking because there are cars parked under it 24/7, blocking all the traffic, and no one ever seems to get a ticket. Is there a secret permit one needs to be allowed to ignore it? I'm just trying to understand the rules of this fascinating game.",0,64
someone burning plastic garbage at night. very bad smoke. breathing problem. plz stop this.,1,14
"You know, my daughter has asthma, so we are always very careful about dust and pollution. But last week, I saw the sanitation worker handling the garbage from near the clinic, and there were used masks and some bloody cotton just mixed in with the regular food waste. It's so incredibly dangerous, not just for the workers but for everyone. What if a child touches it? This isn't just about cleanliness; it's a major health biohazard that needs to be stopped immediately.",1,82
"You are hereby notified that the overflowing garbage bins in our locality have resulted in an increased presence of stray dogs, creating a public nuisance and a safety hazard. Several residents, including children, have been chased. This is a direct consequence of your failure to ensure timely waste collection. We hold your department liable for any incidents. If the collection frequency is not increased within 7 days, we will lodge an official complaint with the Animal Welfare Board.",1,78
"I just love the new artistic centerpiece at our street corner. It used to be a boring, empty space, but now it's graced with a magnificent, overflowing pile of garbage. The vibrant colours of the plastic bags and the rich aroma truly capture the spirit of urban decay. It's so thoughtful of you to provide us with this ever-evolving sculpture. It's a much better use of the space than, say, cleanliness.",1,71
"Hi, I'm trying to understand the term 'door-to-door' garbage collection. Does it mean the collection vehicle will drive past my door? Or that it will stop near my door? Because it currently stops about three streets away, and we all have to make a run for it. Is there a specific interpretation of 'door-to-door' that I'm missing? I'm just curious about the definition.",1,63

"My son and his friends saved up money to buy a new football, and they were so excited to play at the community sports ground. But when they got there, a bunch of older men were using the entire field to dry their laundry and papads. The boys were so disappointed. That ground is the only place they have to play. It's a public sports facility, not a private laundromat. There should be a security guard or some rules to make sure it's used for its real purpose.",2,88
"Let the record show that the fire hydrant located in the main market area (ID: FH-MKT-04) is non-operational and appears to be heavily corroded. This is a severe public safety violation and a dereliction of your emergency preparedness duty. In the event of a fire, this failure could have catastrophic consequences. I demand an immediate inspection and certification of all hydrants in the area. Your department is now on notice of this critical lapse.",2,74
"Thank you so much for the free public Wi-Fi at the bus station. It's a fantastic service. I especially enjoy the part where it says 'Connected, No Internet'. It's a beautifully philosophical statement about the modern condition: the illusion of connection without any actual substance. It gives me a lot to ponder while I wait for my bus. The service is useless, but the existential lesson is priceless.",2,68
"Excuse me, I was just wondering if the public library has changed its working hours. The sign on the door says it opens at 10 AM, but it's now 11:30 AM on a Wednesday and the doors are still locked. Is there a new secret holiday I'm not aware of? Or is '10 AM' just a suggested opening time, a flexible guideline? Just trying to plan my reading schedule.",2,69
junction box near my house is open. all wires are visible. very dangerous in rain. plz cover it.,3,18
"Last week during that big storm, the power went off and on about five times in a minute. There was a loud 'thak' sound from my fridge, and now it's not cooling at all. The repairman said the compressor is gone because of the power surge. That's a Rs. 8,000 expense for me. This happens every time there's bad weather. These fluctuations are destroying our expensive appliances, and we have no one to hold accountable. It feels like we're being punished for paying our bills.",3,85
"This is a formal complaint regarding the unscheduled power shutdown in our area for over 8 hours today, August 27, 2025. No prior notification was provided via any medium, violating the citizen's charter. This has resulted in significant disruption to work-from-home residents and financial loss for local businesses. We demand a public explanation for this failure in communication and service. Continued disregard for notification protocols will be escalated to the regulatory commission.",3,72
"I am in awe of the mathematical genius who calculates my electricity bill. To arrive at such a fantastically high number from my humble two-fan, three-lightbulb house is a feat of creative accounting that deserves an award. You have charged me for more units than I could possibly consume even if I were running a secret data center. Thank you for making me feel so powerful. Now, could you please send a corrected bill based on, you know, reality?",3,79
"Hello, I have a question about the process for getting a new electricity connection. After submitting all 20 documents and paying the fees, I was told a technician would visit. He visited and said I need another document. I submitted it. Now I'm told another person has to visit for a different inspection. Is this a multi-stage treasure hunt? Are there clues I'm supposed to be finding at each office? Just wondering how many levels are left until I win the final prize: electricity.",3,84

"My uncle was coming to visit us on his scooter last night, and there's that sharp turn near the end of the bypass road that has no warning sign or mirror. It was raining, and he didn't realize how sharp the curve was. He skidded and fell, and now he has a fractured wrist. It's a miracle it wasn't worse. That spot is so dangerous, everyone in the neighborhood knows it. A simple convex mirror or a warning sign could prevent a real tragedy there. We feel so helpless.",0,89
"This is a formal notice, dated August 27, 2025. The abysmal condition of the road in our area, which has deteriorated further this monsoon, has caused significant damage to my car's axle. I have an invoice for Rs. 12,800 for the repair. This is a direct result of your department's failure to maintain public infrastructure. I am holding you liable for this amount and demand a response regarding reimbursement within 15 days, failing which I will initiate legal proceedings for damages.",0,81
"I must admire the patchwork on our road. It’s like a quilt of different shades of tar and concrete. Each patch tells a story of a pothole that once was, and the new cracks around it promise stories of potholes yet to come. This commitment to reactive maintenance over actual paving is a masterclass in inefficiency. It’s not a road; it’s a living museum of temporary fixes. Truly visionary.",0,69
"Hi, quick question. I was driving through the main market square today, and I noticed cars coming from all five directions at once, with no one stopping. Are traffic signals and right-of-way rules optional in that specific zone? Is it a special autonomous region where we communicate our intentions telepathically? I just want to make sure I'm following the local customs correctly.",0,62
drain is choked. all rain water coming inside my house now. plz send someone urgently. ground floor is flooded.,1,19
"For six months, we've been complaining about that empty corner plot. It used to be a clean space, but people started throwing one or two bags of garbage, and now it's a massive, stinking dump. We residents even tried cleaning it once, but by the next week, it was full again. The smell is so bad, especially in this August humidity, and we're worried about dengue because of all the stagnant water. All it would take is one visit from a JCB and a truck to clear it, but nobody listens.",1,91
"Let the record show that the large garbage dump located behind the community center is a significant health hazard. Given the current monsoon season, it has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other disease vectors. This is a direct violation of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. Should there be an outbreak of dengue or cholera in this vicinity, this notice will serve as proof of your department's prior knowledge and subsequent negligence. We demand immediate and complete removal of this waste.",1,83
"Ah, the aroma of the overflowing community bin. It's a unique fragrance for this warm August afternoon—a complex bouquet of rotting vegetables, stale food, and a mysterious hint of something I can only describe as 'regret'. It really adds an unforgettable sensory layer to our neighborhood. Why pay for expensive scented candles when the municipality provides this organic, all-pervading perfume for free? It’s a truly thoughtful gesture.",1,67
"Hello, I was just looking at my property tax bill, and I see a line item for 'Swachh Bharat Cess'. I was just wondering, is there a specific service that this tax is for? Is it for the theoretical concept of cleanliness? Because the garbage on my street has not been collected in nine days, and I'm trying to connect the payment I made with the service I'm supposed to be receiving. Could you please clarify what this cess actually entails?",1,81
park gym equipment is rusted. the leg press is jammed. cant use it. plz do maintenance.,2,16
"My grandchildren came over yesterday, and they were so excited to go to the park. But when we got there, it was just sad. The little slide for toddlers has a jagged crack right down the middle, the see-saw is missing a handle, and the swings look so rusted I was scared to even push them. I had to tell them they couldn't play on anything because it was all too dangerous. Seeing their disappointed faces was heartbreaking. It’s the only park for miles, and it’s completely unsafe for the kids it was built for.",2,95
"This is a formal complaint regarding the non-compliance of the new community center building with the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. The building lacks a functional wheelchair ramp, tactile paving, and accessible toilets, making it unusable for several citizens. This is a clear violation of the law. We demand an immediate accessibility audit and the prompt installation of the required infrastructure. Failure to comply will be reported to the appropriate state commission.",2,74
"I tried the open-air gym today. It was a thrilling experience. The elliptical machine has a delightful wobble that tests your balance and core strength in unexpected ways. And using the chest press machine, with its rusted, groaning parts, is a fantastic test of courage. Will it work, or will it collapse? It's an adrenaline rush every time! Thank you for providing us with this 'extreme sports' version of a public gym. It’s so much more exciting than just working out.",2,81
"Good afternoon. I was hoping to book the community hall for my daughter's birthday party, but the watchman said it's full of old broken furniture and files, and he doesn't have the key anyway. Is the hall's official purpose now a municipal storage unit? The sign outside still says 'Community Hall for Public Use'. I'm just a bit confused about its current status. Is there a different, secret community hall we're supposed to be using?",2,75
meter box seal is broken. anyone can tamper. very risky. plz send someone to put new seal.,3,17
"The power went out yesterday at 10 in the morning and didn't come back until almost 10 at night. Twelve hours! I had just bought all the groceries for the week. The milk, yogurt, all the vegetables in the fridge are spoiled. In this heat, everything goes bad so quickly. This isn't the first time. We pay our bills, but we're throwing away hundreds of rupees of food every month because of these endless power cuts. It feels like we are being robbed.",3,83
"This notice is to formally protest the unscheduled power outage that occurred on August 26, 2025, lasting over 12 hours. As a freelance designer working from home, this shutdown resulted in a direct and quantifiable financial loss due to missed deadlines. Your failure to provide any prior notification is a breach of service standards. I will be seeking recourse through the consumer forum for the loss of income and professional damages caused by your department's unreliability.",3,76
"I'd like to thank the electricity department for its new 'Intermittent Power' feature. Having electricity for only a few hours a day is a wonderful way to reduce my carbon footprint and my dependence on modern technology. I've rediscovered the simple joys of reading a book in near-darkness and eating dinner before the sun sets. Your dedication to helping us live a more rustic, pre-industrial lifestyle is truly commendable. My productivity is zero, but my spirit is enlightened.",3,78
"Hello, I have a physics question for your technical team. Every time it starts to rain, even a light drizzle, the power in our entire area immediately trips. Is there a direct, previously unknown scientific link between water droplets and the immediate failure of your grid infrastructure? Or is it simply that the equipment is so old and poorly maintained that it's scared of a little water? I'm just trying to understand the science behind this predictable failure.",3,78
"The asphalt on our main road is peeling off, creating multiple large potholes. The entire road surface is uneven, making driving difficult. We need immediate bitumen repair work before the cracks get worse. This poor road condition is a major safety hazard, especially for two-wheelers. The lack of maintenance is evident, and the road requires complete resurfacing, not just temporary patching of the potholes.",0,64
"The traffic signal at the university junction is faulty. The timer is not working, and it often gets stuck on red, causing long traffic jams. This malfunctioning signal is a daily nuisance. We request the authorities to inspect the controller and repair the timer unit. Proper functioning of this traffic signal is crucial for managing the heavy flow of vehicles and pedestrians in this busy area.",0,66
"Several streetlights in our sector are not functional. The old sodium vapour lamps are fused. We request their replacement with new energy-efficient LED lamps. The darkness creates a security risk at night. The specific electric pole number is C-144. Proper street lighting is a basic necessity, and the lack of functional streetlights makes the entire lane unsafe after sunset.",0,59
"Every monsoon, our street faces severe waterlogging due to a choked drainage system. The road is submerged for days, damaging the surface and making it impossible to walk. A key issue is a broken manhole cover which allows garbage to clog the drain. We need a permanent solution involving cleaning the entire drainage line and fixing the manhole cover to prevent this annual waterlogging problem.",0,65
"The footpath along the canal is in a deplorable state. The pavement slabs are broken, creating an uneven and dangerous surface for pedestrians. It is extremely difficult for senior citizens to walk here. We demand the reconstruction of this footpath with new interlocking blocks. A safe and well-maintained pavement is essential for people who prefer to walk rather than use vehicles for short distances.",0,64
"The speed breaker recently installed near the school is dangerously high and lacks any road markings. It has damaged several cars. This unscientific speed breaker needs to be redesigned to standard specifications with proper white paint for visibility. Additionally, installing rumble strips before it would provide an advance warning to drivers. The current design is a hazard.",0,57
The lane dividers and zebra crossing markings have completely faded. The absence of these crucial road markings creates chaos and puts pedestrians at risk. We request the immediate repainting of the zebra crossing with thermoplastic paint for durability. Clear road markings are essential for enforcing traffic discipline and ensuring the safety of everyone using the road.,0,56
"The electric pole at the street corner is heavily rusted at the base and is leaning. This damaged pole supports numerous heavy cables and could collapse anytime. We fear for our safety. The electricity department must replace this compromised pole immediately. Proper maintenance of these structures, including regular inspection of each pole, is necessary to prevent accidents.",0,57
"The main issue is the poor road surface quality. The asphalt layer is too thin, and deep cracks have appeared just months after it was laid. This indicates poor workmanship. Driving on this road with its multiple potholes is a nightmare. The authorities should investigate the contractor and ensure the entire road surface is relaid according to proper engineering standards.",0,60
"There is no functional drainage system along the new bypass road. This leads to constant waterlogging, which is now eroding the road's foundation. The lack of a proper outlet for rainwater is a major design flaw. The authorities need to construct a new drainage channel to prevent further damage to the road and address the persistent waterlogging that plagues commuters.",0,60
"The garbage container in our locality is constantly overflowing. The waste collection is irregular, and the single dustbin is not enough for the entire community. The resulting stench is unbearable and poses a significant hygiene issue. We demand an additional garbage container and a regular daily waste collection service to maintain basic sanitation in the area.",1,56
"Our main sewer line is completely blocked, leading to sewage overflowing from a manhole. The foul-smelling wastewater has flooded the street, making it impossible to step out. This blockage is a serious health hazard. We need an emergency team with a jetting machine to clear the sewer line. This recurring blockage points to a deeper issue in the area's sanitation infrastructure.",1,61
"The open drainage channel is choked with plastic and silt. The municipal sweeper is never seen on our street, and there is no regular cleaning. This choked drainage is a breeding ground for mosquitoes. The lack of proper sanitation is alarming. We need the drains to be desilted immediately, and a regular schedule for the sweeper to be implemented.",1,59
Illegal dumping of construction debris is happening on a vacant plot near our homes. The pile of rubble is an eyesore and is causing dust pollution. This unauthorized dumping continues unchecked. The municipality must clear the debris and penalize those responsible to maintain the locality's hygiene and environment. Fencing the plot could prevent future dumping.,1,55
"We are facing a serious sanitation crisis. The door-to-door waste collection has stopped, forcing residents to dispose of their garbage in street corners. This has created multiple small dumping grounds. The foul smell and stray animals are a constant problem. We need the waste collection service to be restored immediately to ensure proper hygiene.",1,54
"The issue is the lack of waste segregation. We separate our wet and dry waste, but the collectors mix it all. What is the point of segregation if the system doesn't support it? This defeats the entire purpose of responsible waste management. The municipality needs to provide compartmented trucks and train their staff on the importance of segregation to improve the sanitation chain.",1,63
"A broken manhole cover is overflowing with raw sewage. The stench is nauseating, and it is a grave risk to public health. This sewer line needs immediate attention. The authorities must replace the cover and clear the blockage. This kind of neglect of the sewage system is unacceptable and affects the basic hygiene of our neighborhood.",1,56
"We found biomedical waste, including used syringes, mixed in our residential garbage. This is extremely hazardous for the sanitation workers. This illegal dumping is likely from a nearby clinic. The health department must investigate this serious lapse in biomedical waste disposal and take strict action against the violators to protect public health.",1,52
The large community dustbin has not been emptied for over a week. This overflowing container is attracting pests and dogs. The irregularity of waste collection is the root cause of this problem. The foul smell spreads across several streets. We need this overflowing pile of garbage to be cleared on a priority basis.,1,53
"The underground drainage system is choked, causing wastewater to back up into our homes. This choked drain is a result of years of neglect and lack of cleaning. The entire sanitation of the area is compromised. We demand a comprehensive cleaning of the drainage network to resolve this recurring problem and prevent health issues.",1,54
"The children's park is in a state of neglect. The play equipment, especially the swing and the slide, is broken and rusty. This poses a safety risk to our children. There has been no maintenance for months. We request the authorities to repair the swing set and install a new slide. A safe park is essential for the community's children.",2,60
"The public benches in the lakeside garden are all broken. This is a popular spot for senior citizens, but they have no place to sit. Proper maintenance of these basic amenities is required. We ask the concerned department to repair or replace these broken benches so that everyone can enjoy the public space comfortably.",2,54
"The community hall is unusable. The walls need painting, the lighting is poor, and the public toilet facilities are filthy. This hall was built for public use but due to lack of maintenance, it lies in ruins. We request a complete renovation of the community hall so that we can use it for local functions and gatherings.",2,57
"The bus shelter near the main market has a broken roof. It offers no protection from the sun or rain. Commuters are facing a lot of hardship. A proper bus shelter is a basic public amenity. The transport department must repair the roof and also install some benches for passengers, especially the elderly, to sit on.",2,56
"The public water tap at the city square has been dry for weeks. This was the only source of free drinking water for many vendors and commuters. In this heat, access to drinking water is critical. We urge the authorities to investigate the issue and restore the water supply through this tap immediately.",2,53
The public toilet and urinal complex at the bus stand is extremely unhygienic. There is no regular cleaning or water supply. It is a source of disease. A clean public toilet is a matter of public health and dignity. We need the municipality to ensure this facility receives proper daily maintenance and has an uninterrupted water connection.,2,57
"The open-air gym in our local park has broken equipment. The leg press machine is jammed, and a handle on the elliptical is missing. This lack of maintenance makes the gym equipment unsafe to use. Regular inspection and repair of the public gym is necessary to prevent injuries.",2,48
The jogging track in the central park is full of cracks and is poorly lit. The uneven surface is dangerous for runners. We request the authorities to resurface the jogging track and improve the lighting around it. Proper maintenance of this facility is important for the health and safety of hundreds of citizens who use it daily.,2,57
"The boundary fence of the children's park is broken. This allows stray dogs to enter, which is a major concern for the safety of our children using the play equipment. A secure fence is the most basic requirement for a children's park. We ask for immediate repair of the damaged fence.",2,51
"The public library is in a pathetic condition. There is a shortage of chairs, and most of the ceiling fans do not work. It is difficult to study in such conditions. This important public amenity needs urgent maintenance. We request new furniture and repair of the electrical fittings to make the library a comfortable space for readers.",2,57
We are experiencing frequent power cuts without any prior notice. These long outages are disrupting our work and daily life. The electricity supply is highly unreliable. We need the department to provide a stable power supply and inform us about any scheduled shutdowns. These regular power cuts are unacceptable.,3,49
"The transformer in our area is leaking oil and makes a loud humming sound. We fear there might be a short circuit or a blast. This old transformer, probably a 100 kVA unit, is clearly overloaded. We request an urgent inspection and replacement of this hazardous transformer to ensure the safety of the residents.",3,54
"There is a severe low voltage problem in our area. The electricity supply is often below 180V, which can damage our appliances. This constant voltage fluctuation needs to be fixed. The department should check the local substation and take corrective measures to provide a stable voltage. The current low voltage makes it impossible to use air conditioners or water pumps.",3,60
"My electricity meter is faulty. The monthly billing shows extremely high consumption, which is incorrect. I have complained multiple times, but the faulty meter has not been replaced. This is causing me financial stress. I demand an immediate inspection of my meter and a correction in my outstanding billing amount.",3,50
"Several power lines are hanging dangerously low, almost touching our building. These bare wires are a major safety hazard, especially during rains. We have requested the replacement of these old wires with new aerial bunched cables. The electricity department must address this issue before a fatal accident occurs due to these sagging power lines.",3,54
A concrete electric pole is cracked and looks like it might fall. It supports several high-tension wires. This is a disaster waiting to happen. The structural integrity of this pole is compromised. We urge the authorities to replace this damaged electric pole immediately to prevent any loss of life or property.,3,51
The main fuse unit for our apartment building trips multiple times a day. This indicates a severe overload or a fault in the main cable. We are tired of the frequent power outages. An engineer needs to inspect the substation feeder and the main fuse box to find a permanent solution.,3,51
"We often see sparks from the insulator on the high-tension line passing our colony. This is a very scary sight and a potential fire hazard. The cracked insulator needs to be replaced immediately. Proper maintenance of the high-tension infrastructure, including regular checks for faulty insulators, is crucial for safety.",3,49
The billing from the electricity department is completely arbitrary. There seems to be no connection between the meter reading and the final bill amount. We need transparency in the billing process. The department should clarify the tariff structure and ensure the meter readings are accurate to avoid harassing consumers with inflated bills.,3,52
"Due to constant voltage fluctuation, my television's motherboard got burnt. The unstable electricity supply is damaging our valuable electronics.
